Welcome to the course website for the Introduction to Fullstack Development Decal! This is deployed to [fullstackdecal.com](https://fullstackdecal.com) on push, but you can make edits to content here!

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window (most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server).

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
