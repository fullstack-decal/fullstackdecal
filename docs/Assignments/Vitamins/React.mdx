# React

### **Introduction**

In this assignment, you will learn how to set up a basic React project, create components, and use key React Hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`. You'll also learn how to manage navigation between pages using React Router. The goal is to give you hands-on practice with some of the core concepts in React.

### **Learning Objectives**

- Understand how to set up a new React project.
- Learn how to use important React Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.
- Set up routes to navigate between different pages using React Router.
- Manage state within components and maintain it across the application.

We will create a basic react website that looks like this:

- Everything I‚Äôve shown you must look like this (in terms of content, not design). But, feel free to add more pages/content if you‚Äôd like, as long as you have this base down!
 
 ![React Website](./AssignmentAssets/vitamin4-react-img/screenshot2.png)

Clicking on Home will redirect you to:

 ![React Website: Home](./AssignmentAssets/vitamin4-react-img/screenshot1.png)

Clicking on Not Home will redirect you to:

 ![React Website: NotHome](./AssignmentAssets/vitamin4-react-img/screenshot3.png)

- Clicking on Increase, will increase the counter bar by +1, conversely, clicking on decrease will result in -1.
- if the counter display shows more than 5, there will be a pop up comment on the bottom that says: You passed 5! (this will only show if its 5+).

### **Part 1: Setting Up a React Project**

1. **Create Your Project Folder in your preferred editor (such as VS code):**
    - Use `npx` to create a new React project. It sets up everything you need, including the basic folder structure and initial files.
        - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. **Running the React Project:**
    - Start your React app locally. You‚Äôll see the default welcome page in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Feel free to delete the default content to start fresh.
    - Every time you make changes to your code, the browser will automatically reload to reflect your changes. This makes development easier since you can see changes instantly.
3. **Stop and Restart the Server:**
    - If you need to stop the server at any time, press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal where the project is running.
4. **Install React Router:**
    - Install `react-router-dom` so you can add routing to your app.
        - React Router is not included in the default project, so we need to install it. This will allow us to create navigation between different pages in our app.
5. **Verify Installation:** After installation, check your `package.json` file under `dependencies` to make sure `react-router-dom` was added. It should look like this:
    
    ```json
    "dependencies": {
      "react": "^17.0.2",
      "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
      "react-router-dom": "^6.0.0",
      "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
    }
    ```

### **Part 2: Creating Basic Components**

1. **Organize Folders:**
    - Inside the `src` folder, create two subfolders: `components` (for reusable components) and `pages` (for different pages of your app).
    - **Why are we doing this?**
        - Breaking your app into reusable components is a key part of React. It allows you to keep your code organized and modular. Components are self-contained and can be reused in different parts of your app.
2. **Create a Navbar Component:**
    - In the `components` folder, create a `Navbar` folder with two files: `Navbar.js` and `Navbar.css`.
    - Write the logic for the `Navbar.js` component that includes links to different pages and style it using `Navbar.css`.
        - css does not need to be exact!
    
    Here‚Äôs some starter code to help you out:
    
    ```bash
    //import React
    // Import Link to navigate between pages
    // Import the CSS file for styling
    
    const Navbar = () => {
      return (
       // fill in the rest here!
       // add Home and NotHome, including links (after routing established)
    };
    
    // Always export your components so they can be imported in other files
    
    ```
    
3. **Add the Navbar to App.js:**
    - Open `App.js` and import the `Navbar` component so it appears on every page of the app.
4. **Wrap App in Router:**
    - In `index.js`, wrap the `App` component with `Router` so routing works across the app.
    
    Starter code to help you out:
    
    ```jsx
    //import required here
    
    ReactDOM.render( 
    //... router here, etc.
    );
    
    ```
    - NOTE: This was not done in Lecture 10, where the router was only wrapped in the `App.js` file. This is sufficient for smaller and simpler apps. However, placing the Router in index.js gives you more flexibility to wrap additional components around the entire app, such as global providers (e.g., context providers or Redux store providers) while still having routing available throughout. This is a common pattern in larger apps.
    - If you are struggling on step 4, you can feel free to follow Lecture 9 and skip this step. But, you will need to learn this eventually.
5. **Set Up Routes in App.js:**
    - Add routes for `Home` and `NotHome` pages in `App.js`. Define the paths and link them to the correct components.
        - Home path = /home
        - NotHome path = /nothome
6. **Create Home and NotHome Pages:**
    - In the `pages` folder, create folders for `Home` and `NotHome`. In each folder, create a simple component that displays a title below the navbar.

### **Part 3: Using React Hooks**

Now that you have the basic app structure, let's dive into React Hooks! Hooks let you manage state and side effects in functional components.

1. **useState Hook:**
    - `useState` helps manage dynamic values like a counter or form inputs that need to change as the user interacts with your app.
    - In the `NotHome` component, implement a counter using `useState`. Add buttons to increase or decrease the counter.
2. **useEffect Hook:**
    - `useEffect` allows you to perform side effects in your component, such as fetching data or updating the document title. It runs after the component renders.
    - Add logic to update the counter. Use `useEffect` to reset the counter if it goes below 0 and show the message ‚ÄúYou passed 5!‚Äù  if it passes 5.


### **Part 4: Submitting Your Assignment**

When submitting your React project to Gradescope, please follow the instructions below carefully so we can grade your work efficiently.

#### üìù What to Include:
- `src/` ‚Äì Your main React code lives here.
- `public/` ‚Äì The static files like `index.html` and favicon.
- `package.json` ‚Äì Lists the dependencies needed for your app.
- `package-lock.json` ‚Äì Locks versions of packages used.
- `.gitignore` ‚Äì To show you understood how to use it (see next section!)

> You can submit this as a zipped `.zip` file or upload each file/folder on Gradescope.

#### ‚ùå What *Not* to Include:
- `node_modules/` ‚Äì It contains **thousands of downloaded files** and **bloats your project**.  
  It also causes **Gradescope to lag or error out**, which is a pain for everyone.

> Why don‚Äôt we want it? Because if we have the `package.json`, we can just run `npm install` or `yarn install` to regenerate `node_modules`.
---

### **Part 5: How to use gitignore**

So you're wondering‚Ä¶  
**How do I ignore the `node_modules` folder so it doesn‚Äôt get pushed to GitHub or uploaded to Gradescope?**

**How do I ignore any file in general when uploading to github?**

Super easy ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through it.


#### Step 1: Create a `.gitignore` File

In the **root directory** of your project, create a file called `.gitignore`, unless it already exists.

> This literally means "git, ignore this!" 


#### Step 2: Add `node_modules` to It

Open the `.gitignore` file and type:

```
/node_modules
```

This tells Git to **ignore the entire `node_modules` folder**, which is auto-generated when you run:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

---

### IMPORTANT: Use the Correct Path

You must refer to the **correct relative path** of `node_modules` in your `.gitignore`. Let‚Äôs go over two examples:


#### üìÅ Standard Setup

If you used Create React App (CRA) or a similar tool, your folder might look like this:

```
my-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

In this case, your `.gitignore` should include:

```
/node_modules
```

> This means: "Ignore the `node_modules` folder in the root directory."


#### üìÅ Complex Project Setup

What if your project is nested like this?

```
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

Then your `.gitignore` should use:

```
/apps/frontend/node_modules
```

> This means: "Ignore the `node_modules` folder inside `apps/frontend/`."

---

### TL;DR:

- **Always** use `.gitignore` to ignore `node_modules`
- **Never** push `node_modules` to GitHub or Gradescope ‚Äî it‚Äôs **huge**, **auto-generated**, and **breaks stuff**
- **Use correct relative paths** based on your folder structure
- For simplicity:  
  üìÅ Put `.gitignore` in the **same folder** as the `node_modules` you want to ignore.

---

> üí¨ Still not sure if it‚Äôs working? Run:
> ```bash
> git status
> ```
> and make sure `node_modules` doesn‚Äôt show up in the list of files Git is tracking.



> **‚ö†Ô∏è For all future react usages, do NOT upload node_modules or else you will be penalized.**
