# Vitamin 1: HTML

## Introduction

In this vitamin we want students to learn how to create an HTML webpage using all the widely used common HTML tags.

Although this is your first homework, if you bear with us, we’ll try our best to guide you through it. Today, you’ll be creating a webpage about famous Stranger Things actor Steve Harrington. This website includes an image, a table of contents, headings, paragraphs, and so much more!

Please follow the exact content given in the following instructions above and try to copy the above image exactly so that the autograder can give you full points.

Your website at the end should look something like this:
![Absolute Image](./AssignmentAssets/Webpage_ss.png)

## **Learning Objectives**

- Using essential HTML (text) tags
  - h1, h2, p, b, i, sub, sup, br, etc.
  - Creating bulleted lists using `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` tags
- Embedding an image in the webpage using `<img>`. Alternate text prop
- Linking to different pages - 1 live page and 1 local page (`<a>` tag).
- A button to perform a basic task like an alert.
- Creating a basic form on the local page.
- Basic info about meta tags

## Setup

Create a folder somewhere on your computer. In this folder, create
an HTML file named `index.html`.

:::info What is index.html?
The file name index.html is often used for landing pages as many
web servers treat it as the 'default' document. As in, when you go
to https://apple.com/, it's really loading https://apple.com/index.html!
:::

## Question 0: Boilerplate

Every HTML file must have some bare-minimum code to be considered valid, known as the boilerplate. Right now your `index.html` file
should be empty. Add the boilerplate to your website. If you forgot how to do this, refer to the [HTML lesson](../../Lessons/Lesson2).

:::info
_Must_ is a strong word. Browsers today are built to be extremely compliant, even if an HTML file is invalid.
That way a user can often see _something_ rather than just a giant error message. This means that if you have an
HTML file that has some syntax error or doesn't have the "boilerplate" it may still _work_.
:::

At the end of this step you should have a:

- doctype declaration
- `<html>` tag
- `<head>` tag
- `<body>` tag

## Question 1: Title, Heading

First, we will need a title to tell our readers what they will be reading about

- Set the title of the webpage as “Steve Harrington Tribute”.
- After the title, set the heading as “Steve Harrington”. This should be a size 1 heading (**hint:** h1).

:::tip Title vs heading?
In HTML, the word "title" refers to what appears in the browser menu bar, while "heading" refers to text in the
document's content.
:::

## Question 2: Links

Now, let's add a link that navigates the user to elsewhere on the web! Use the `<a>` tag to add a link to the actual Wikipedia page from your wiki page. 
Here's the link to the actual wiki page. Look up the **`<a>`** tag to see how you can make the new page open up in a new tab.

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harrington

## Question 3: Content

Copy the following paragraph into your HTML page using a `<p>` tag:

> Steve Harrington is a fictional character from the Netflix television show Stranger Things, portrayed by Joe Keery.
> While starting out as a typical unlikable jock, Steve has grown into a more protecting and caring character
> as the show has progressed, a development that has received widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike
> and has led to him becoming one of the show’s most beloved and enduring characters.[1]
> Initially a part of the recurring cast, Keery was promoted to the main cast in the second season.
> Steve is a side antagonist turned protagonist at the end of season 1,
> and one of the main protagonists of season 2, season 3, and season 4.

## Question 4: Celebrity Image

Now insert Steve Harrington’s image using the `<img>` tag. Use a height of 250px.

## Question 5: Table of Contents

Let's make a table of contents, like the Wikipedia page, except that we will not include links just yet. Instead, our table of contents will be simply text for now.
Use `ul` and `li` tags to create a table of contents. Have the table of contents list the topics:

- Fictional Character Biography
- In Popular Culture
- Reception
- References

Above this table of contents, create an _level 3 heading_ named "Contents"

## Question 6: Website Content

Now we are going to write some real stuff and go deeper in the content!

Now create an `<h2>` section named "Fictional Character biography". For each season [from the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harrington#Fictional_character_biography)
Create an `<h3>` section for that season, and copy and paste the text using a `<p>` tag.

## Question 7: Metadata

The `<meta>` tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

Tags like `title` and `meta` go into the `<head></head>` of your HTML document. These tags are responsible for telling search engines and the browser top-level information about your site.

A common structure is `<meta name="____", description="____"/>`

[HTML meta tags](https://web.dev/learn/html/metadata/#named-meta-tags)

Add a "description" and "theme-color" meta tag to your website.

:::info What did this do?
You probably won't see any changes when you add these tags. That's because meta tags are supposed to be machine-parseable
pieces of info.
:::

## Conclusion

This concludes your fanpage. You are now a Steve Harrington superfan! Even if not a Stranger Things fan,
we hope you are now an HTML fan. Remember, HTML is the outline of the Internet.
In this homework, we learned how to layout and template content.
While it looks ugly right now, we will see in the next homework how to add some snazzy style and even more functionality!

To submit, proceed to `Gradescope > Vitamin 1`. Upload a `.zip` file containing your HTML file (if you have other files your
HTML file references, include those too!)
