# Databases

This assignment should take around an hour to complete and will give you a basic understanding of SQL, MongoDB, and creating a simple backend with Express.js that interacts with both databases.

**Part 1: Basics of SQL**

1. Install MySQL
    - instructions to install  mySQL community server (actual SQL) **AND** the [mySQL workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) (application only)
    - NOTE: when downloading mySQL community server, it will ask you to write a password before downloading. YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS PASSWORD in order to create and use your SQL servers, so don’t forget it!

2. Open up mySQL workbench application

- create a new connection —> you will be prompted to enter your password you made for mysql when you downloaded it
    - You can test the connection, there should be a prompt that opens up and say:
        
        :::tip 📌 **Successfully made the MySQL connection**
        
        Information related to this connection:
        
        Host: localhost
        Port: 3306
        User: root
        SSL: enabled with…
        
        A successful MySQL connection was made with
        the parameters defined for this connection.
        
        :::
        
1. Create Database and table on mySQL workbench
    - Create a database called “company_db” (without the quotations)
    - Create a table within company_db called “employees”. Make sure to add columns that satisfy:
        - “id” - this is an auto increment primary key
        - “name” - make sure this is a variable character and can store up to 255 characters and that the column cannot have null values.
        - “position” - make sure this is a variable character and can store up to 255 characters and that the column cannot have null values.
        - “salary” - make sure this is a decimal and can store up to 10 digits in 2 places and the column cannot have null values.
    - Insert these three exact values into the database to its proper columns (capitals matter):
        - Alice who is a Developer and has a salary of 75000.
        - Bob who is a Designer and has a salary of 65000.
        - Charlie who is a Manager and has a salary of 85000.
2. Query the data. When you input this into SQL that retrieves the data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

- This should exactly output:

```sql
+----+---------+-----------+--------+
| id | name    | position  | salary |
+----+---------+-----------+--------+
|  1 | Alice   | Developer | 75000.00 |
|  2 | Bob     | Designer  | 65000.00 |
|  3 | Charlie | Manager   | 85000.00 |
+----+---------+-----------+--------+
```

**Part 2: Basics of MongoDB**

1. Install MongoDB
    1. If you would like to see mongodb visually, use MongoDB Compass. This application is much easier to navigate than on the terminal.
2. **Connect to the MongoDB Server**:
    - Establish a connection to your MongoDB server.
        - Make sure it is connected to your local host —> **localhost:27017**
3. Create a database name called companyDB, and a collection name called projects.
4. Create and choose the collection called “projects” where you want to insert the documents and add the following data 
    1. name: Project A with a budget of 5000
    2. name: Project B with a budget of 3000
    3. name: Project C with a budget of 2000
- Each document should be structured as a JSON object.
1. When you query the projects collection, the output should look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("some_object_id1"),
    "name": "Project A",
    "budget": 50000
  },
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("some_object_id2"),
    "name": "Project B",
    "budget": 30000
  },
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("some_object_id3"),
    "name": "Project C",
    "budget": 20000
  }
]
```

**Part 3: Connect with Express.js backend server**

1. create a new project and open it on vscode
2. Install Express.js, mysql, and mongodb libraries (from terminal) on your project
3. Install the following libraries onto your project 
    1. express.js (for node)
    2. mysql2 (for sql)
    3. mongodb (for mongo)
    4. mongoose (for mongo)
- When you install, there should be package.json files automatically outputted in your folder
1. Create the backend server
    1. create a file called server.js
    2. copy the code provided below for the backend (the SQL and MongoDB parts are left empty for you to fill out!)
    3. fill out the TODOs
    
    ```jsx
    // LIBRARIES NEEDED
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const mysql = require('mysql2');
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    
    // SQL CONNECTION
    // TO DO: connect to mysql with the host, database, user, and password. 
    //const connection = ...uncomment this and finish the rest 
    
    // MySQL Connection Verification
    function verifyMySQLConnection() {
        connection.connect(function(err) {
            if (err) {
                console.error('Error connecting to MySQL: ' + err.stack);
                return;
            }
            console.log('MySQL connected as id ' + connection.threadId);
        });
    }
    
    // MONGOOSE CONNECTION
    // TODO: connect to your local host on the companyDB collection
    
    // TODO: Mongoose Schema and Model
    //const ProjectScheme = ...uncomment this and finish the rest
    // const Project Model = ... uncomment this and finish the rest
    
    // MongoDB Connection Verification 
    mongoose.connection.on('connected', () => {
        console.log('MongoDB connected successfully');
    });
    
    mongoose.connection.on('error', (err) => {
        console.error('MongoDB connection error:', err);
    });
    
    // ENDPOINTS
    // Endpoint to get all projects from MongoDB when you enter: http://localhost:3000/projects
    app.get('/projects', async (req, res) => {
        try {
            const projects = await ProjectModel.find({});
            res.json(projects);
        } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
            res.status(500).send(err);
        }
    });
    
    // Endpoint to get all employees from MySQL when you enter: http://localhost:3000/employees
    app.get('/employees', function (req, res) {
        connection.query('SELECT * FROM employees', function (error, results, fields) {
            if (error) throw error;
            res.json(results);
        });
    });
    
    // RUNNING THE SERVER
    app.listen(3000, function () {
        console.log('Server is running on port 3000!');
        verifyMySQLConnection();
    });
    ```
    
2. Run the server in the terminal:

```jsx
node server.js
```

1. Test end points using PostMan or on the server itself:
- `http://localhost:3000/employees`
    - Makes sure this url outputs exactly this:
    
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "position": "Developer",
        "salary": "75000.00"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "position": "Designer",
        "salary": "65000.00"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Charlie",
        "position": "Manager",
        "salary": "85000.00"
      }
    ]
    ```
    
- `http://localhost:3000/projects`
    - Makes sure this url outputs exactly this:
    
    ```json
    [
      {
        "_id": ObjectId("some_object_id1"),
        "name": "Project A",
        "budget": 50000
      },
      {
        "_id": ObjectId("some_object_id2"),
        "name": "Project B",
        "budget": 30000
      },
      {
        "_id": ObjectId("some_object_id3"),
        "name": "Project C",
        "budget": 20000
      }
    ]
    ```
