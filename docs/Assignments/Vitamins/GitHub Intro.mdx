# GitHub Intro

For this assignment, you will make a GitHub repository, make a feature branch, add files, and then merge your feature branch into the main branch.

Before starting this assignment, please read [Setup & Submission Information](Submission.mdx). This will provide instructions on how to create and submit assignments.

## Part 1: Setup

Open a new terminal. Navigate to where you want to store your project folder using the `cd` commands we learned in class. We recommend making a new directory for all assignments in this course:
```
cd /path/to/desktop/or/downloads/or/wherever
mkdir full-stack-decal
cd full-stack-decal
```
These commands will make a new directory (`mkdir`) and enter it.

Begin by creating a new GitHub repo on [github.com](https://github.com), and clone it to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/<github username>/<repo name>.git
```

Make sure to not include spaces in your repo name when creating it!

In VSCode, go to File > Open Folder and open your newly cloned project folder.

## Part 2: README

Most project repos contain a file called `README.md` (or sometimes `README.txt`). The `.md` extension is for a markdown file. This lets you tell people what your project is about, and its contents will be displayed on the home page of your project on GitHub.

In VSCode, create a new file (File > New File) and call it `README.md`.

Inside the file, add some info about your project:

```md
# My Project

This is my GitHub repo.
```

In markdown, we use `#` to signify a header. This will make any text following it on the same line big. There is plenty of markdown syntax to learn. Here's some samples:
```md
# Header
## Subheader
### Subsubheader

Regular text

You can include [hyperlinks](https://fullstackdecal.com) and even images: ![logo](https://fullstackdecal.com/img/logo.png)

You can also embed `code` with backticks.
```

Now, add, commit, and push your changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "added readme"
git push
```

Make sure you have no untracked files:
```
git status
```

## Part 3: Branching out!

Now we want to add a new feature. Create a new branch for this feature:
```
git branch hello-world
```
Then we can move into that branch:
```
git checkout hello-world
```

Just as a note, you can combine the last two commands using this if you wish: `git checkout -b hello-world` which creates and switches in one command.

Now that we're in the branch, we can create a new text file `helloworld.txt`. Put anything you want into it.

Add and commit your changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "added helloworld.txt"
git push origin hello-world
```

Great! Now you have a new branch. Let's merge that branch with your sacred main branch. Start by switching to the main branch:
```
git checkout main
```
Then merge the `hello-world` branch into main:
```
git merge hello-world
```
Great! Let's clean up by deleting our old branch:
```
git branch -d hello-world
```
Now push your branch changes:
```
git push
```
(To be explicit, you can also do `git push origin main` which means you push *to* origin aka remote/in the cloud *from* your local main branch, but this shorthand does the same thing.)

If you look on GitHub, you should see your main branch include two files: `README.md` and `helloworld.txt`. We practiced two methods in this vitamin: adding a file via committing directly to the main branch and also adding a file through a branch. In industry, it's typically better practice to work on incremental features in new branches and reserve main for final versions.

All done! Make sure to follow the submission instructions linked at the top of this file.
