# Next.js

## Getting Started 

```txt
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Use the command above to create a new Next.js application. All of the code you will write will be in the main app/ folder.

### Key components and functions startercode
1. **Link**:
   - `Link` is a component provided by Next.js that enables client-side navigation between different pages of your application. It allows you to navigate between pages without causing a full page reload, which results in a faster and smoother user experience.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     import Link from 'next/link';

     function Home() {
       return (
         <div>
           <h1>Welcome to the homepage</h1>
           <Link href="/about">
             <a>Go to About Page</a>
           </Link>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

2. **usePathname()**:
   - `usePathname` is a hook provided by Next.js to get the current pathname in a functional component. This can be useful for conditionally rendering content based on the current route.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';

     function MyComponent() {
       const pathname = usePathname();

       return (
         <div>
           <p>Current pathname: {pathname}</p>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **clsx**:
   - `clsx` is a utility for constructing `className` strings conditionally. It helps in managing classes more dynamically and concisely, often used in conjunction with CSS modules or Tailwind CSS in Next.js projects.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     import clsx from 'clsx';

     function Button({ isPrimary }) {
       return (
         <button className={clsx('btn', { 'btn-primary': isPrimary, 'btn-secondary': !isPrimary })}>
           Click me
         </button>
       );
     }
     ```
     
## Question: Implementing Dark Mode Based on Pathname

1. **Objective**: Apply dark mode styles when the user navigates to a specific pathname, e.g., `/dark-mode`.

2. **Steps**:

   - Use `Link` to navigate to the `/dark-mode` page.
   - Use `usePathname` to get the current pathname.
   - Use `clsx` to conditionally apply dark mode styles based on the pathname.

3. **Code Example**:
## Question: Implement Dark Mode Based on Pathname

### Objective
Create two buttons, one that navigates to the `/dark-mode` page and the `/light-mode` page
Create a dark mode that activates when the user navigates to the `/dark-mode` page.
Create a light mode that activates when the user navigates to the `/dark-mode` page.
The buttons must include `Dark-Mode` and `Light-Mode` in them.

### Starter Code
Complete the `Home` function in the provided starter code to achieve this functionality.
```css
// styles/globals.css
.container {
  padding: 20px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.dark-mode {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
}
```
```jsx
// app/page.js
import Link from 'next/link';
import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation';
import clsx from 'clsx';

// HINT: Use the `usePathname` hook to get the current pathname.
// HINT: Use the `clsx` utility to conditionally apply the 'dark-mode' class.
// HINT: There should also be two new pages we are redirecting to. Think about how we make more pages within Next.js.

function Home() {
  // Your code here
}

export default Home;
