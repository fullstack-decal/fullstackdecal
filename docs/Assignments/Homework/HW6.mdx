# HW 6 - Backend I

# Introduction

In this homework, we will utilize the NASA daily picture API to create a backend server that allows users to store, delete, and retrieve their favorite pictures of planets and nebulas. 

## **Learning Objectives:**

- What is an API?
    - What is the backend and how does the frontend communicate with the backend
- What is HTTP? How to use Postman?
- What is NodeJS
- What is Express and how to use Express to develop APIs

## Basic Intro referring to Lesson 1

**Query Parameters**

Query Parameters are a defined set of parameters attached to the end of a url. You have probably seen this on almost every website you visit. If you are watching a video on Netflix, the url will look something like:

> [https://www.netflix.com/watch/80186941?trackId=14170286](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80186941?trackId=14170286)
> 

The Query Parameters begin after a question mark (?) in the url, and a series of key-value pairs. In this example, the key is *trackId* and the value is *14170286*. If there were multiple query parameters, they would be concatenated by an ‘&’. 

To access a query parameter in Express, we use **req.query**, which returns an object of key-value pairs.

**NASA APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API** 

In this homework, we will be using the NASA APOD API, an API which returns details about the Astronomy Picture of the Day for a specific day. For example, the APOD for Christmas 2018 was the following:

![https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1812/M100_HubbleWfc3_960.jpg](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1812/M100_HubbleWfc3_960.jpg)

Read the details of the APOD API at [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/) before starting on this homework.

## Setup

To use the NASA API, you will need an API key. This is a way of authenticating with the NASA API server, and it is how NASA prevents unauthorized users from calling the API.

To generate an API key, go to [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/) and scroll down to the “Generate API Key” section. Fill in your first name, last name, and email, and click sign up. You should be presented with a similar screen to the following:

Keep track of your API key, you will need it for the first of the homework when making requests to the NASA API.

We also need to setup Express before we begin.

To setup Express, we need to initialize our app object.

```jsx
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.use(express.json())
app.use(express.urlencoded())

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

// CODE GOES Here

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

## Q1 - Which API Call is Correct?

Below are 4 different HTTP calls to the NASA API. Which call will result in all images for the 4th of July weekend on 2022 (2 July to 4 July)? Assume that the API key you have been given is `abc123`.

**Hint:** Which 2 parameters can you use to specify a date range for the APOD API?

```
1. https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key:abc123&start_date:2022-07-02&end_date:2022-07-04
2. https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=abc123&start=2022-07-02&end=2022-07-04
3. https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=abc123&start_date=2022-07-02&end_date=2022-07-04
4. https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=abc123,start_date=2022-07-02,end_date=2022-07-04
```

## Q2 - Spaceman Postman

Your first task is to write a GET route that returns the URL for the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day for a specific date. 

**Query Parameters**

- `date`: the date to fetch the APOD for in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

<aside>
💡 You can assume that any date passed in matches the `YYYY-MM-DD` format

</aside>

**JSON Response**

- `name`: the name of the image (taken from the `title` field of the NASA API response)
- `img_url`: the URL of the image (taken from the `url` field of the NASA API response)

After you’re done with this, use Postman to test your new `/apod-for-date` API to make sure that it’s returning the correct value. For example, if you call the API with the `date`  set to `2020-12-25` , the response should **exactly** match the following:

```json
{
  "name": "Northern Winter Night", 
  "img_url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2012/WinterSceneBlock.jpg"
}
```

After you are done, open `apod.html` and look at the first section. Choose a date and click the “Get Image” button. If you have implemented the API correctly, you should see the corresponding APOD appear along with its name! Feel free to play around with this before moving on to the next section.

**Hint:** You can access the query parameters in your API handler using `req.query`

## Q3 - March to the Moooon 🚀

Now that you have worked with the API for a bit, write a GET route that returns a list of all APODs in March 2020. you **MUST** only use **ONE** call to NASA’s API to answer this question.

**JSON Response**

- `results`: an array of APOD objects, where each entry is in the same form as your response to question 2

**Hint:** How many days are in March?

## Q4 - All month long (GET)

<aside>
💡 **NOTE:** For this question, your method **only** has to work for the year **2020.** We will not be testing for any other years.

</aside>

Building off of the previous question, write a GET route that takes in a query parameter for a month, and returns all images during that month. 

**Query Parameters**

- `month`: the month to fetch all of the APODs for. It will be a lowercase string of the full month name (`january`, `february`, `march`, etc.)

**JSON Response**

- `results`: an array of APOD objects, of the form below, where each entry is in the same form as your response to question 2.

```json
{
	"results": [
		{
				"name": "The Milky Way Galaxy",
				"img_url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2207/SaharaAndromeda_Coy_1080.jpg"
		},
		{
				"name": "The Chocolate Milk Galaxy",
				"img_url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2207/SaharaAndromeda_Coy_1080.jpg"
	]
}
```

**Hint**: As you implement this API, you might notice that it is similar to your solution for Q3. How might you reuse the code in Q3 for this question as well?

**Hint:** Use the built in javascript object, Date().

**Hint:** const moonLanding = new Date('July 20, 69 00:20:18');

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You should now be familiar with using Postman, formatting an API call, and create custom API endpoints of your own. These are all very valuable skills that you will use extensively as you explore further into backend development.
