# Node.js and Package Managers

## Introduction

You are very familiar with Javascript by now, and you may notice that we can
only run Javascript in our browser using the `<script>` tag. What if we want to
write scripts using Javascript and run them using the local machines, just like
how python is.

This is where Node comes into play. It is a JavaScript runtime engine built on
Chrome's V8 Javascript engine that allows you to run JavaScript even without a
browser. This means that you are able to do a lot more with JavaScript: managing
local files, connecting and setting up a server, and much more.

### Learning Objectives

1. How npm & node works
2. Create Backend APIs using Node & Express
3. How to make API calls using axios
4. File system with node & express
5. Understand cookies

### Getting Started

Let's start by creating a folder for us to put our code in. Let's call this
folder `example` and then let's cd` into it using the console.

```bash
mkdir example
cd example
```

## NPM

With the ability to run JavaScript locally on our machine (with the help of
Node) and the contribution of a rich number of packages from a large community,
the possibilities for JavaScript are endless!

To manage many of the packages that give Node its most powerful abilities, we
use NPM. Node package manager (NPM) is a place where you can find and download
node packages.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installing Node

Go to [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install node.js for
free.

Let us confirm that you have correctly downloaded Node.js and npm.

In the terminal, type

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If both lines output the version number then we are good.

Now, let us install out first package. The remainder of this example we will be
using Axios to make HTTP requests as necessary, so let us install Axios.

Navigate to the folder where we are storing our project, in this case `example/`
while there, type the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install axios
```

The `npm init` command is used to create a new npm package, essentially every
node script that we will write can be treated as a npm package. The `-y` flag
just skip all the configuration step and creates a most basic npm package with
all default settings.

Now when we list the files in our `example/` directory, we should see three
things:

- `node_modules` folder
- `package.json` file
- `package-lock.json` file (optional)

Essentially, each of these helps npm organize the packages we installed. In the
node_modules folder is where we can find our actual packages. Many times, our
node_modules file grows incredibly large and can take up quite a bit of space.
It is discouraged to go directly into the node_modules, instead, npm provides a
variety of utilities which we can use to keep our projects clean and efficient.
I won't go into them here, but as you develop, you will run across them or you
can read the docs [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules). The other
file is the package.json file. The package.json file is the file which record
and defines the top-level packages and dependencies for our project.
package-lock.json is a similar idea but with some nuances, you do not need to
worry about those.

## Hello World

Now let's move back to Node for a second. Let's create a file called
`helloworld.js` in the `example/` folder. Enter `console.log("hello world.")` in
the file.

You can run any node file by using the Node command.

```bash
node helloworld.js
```

The console should print "hello world." and then exit.

## JS in Browser vs. Node.js

Node in browser and Node.js are technically the same form of JavaScript. Both
run on the browser's JavaScript engine, usually Chrome V8. However, there are
some fundamental difference which make Node.js just different enough to be
annoying. The most prominent difference is that Node.js uses the `require`
module to import other modules which define functionality. All Node projects are
organized into modules, and we use `require` to import them. For example, the
following code imports Axios, a package commonly used to make HTTP requests.

Another difference is that since there is no web page to be manipulated, there
is no `document` object for Node.js, which means that DOM manipulation cannot be
carried out in Node.js (with the help of some packages, it can).

Since Node is a server side language, it can interact with the local file system
easily, it also provides ways to setup a server with ease.

If you are familiar with the `fetch` function in JS, there is no fetch function
in Node. You can use the http package or some other third party package to
handle sending a request.
