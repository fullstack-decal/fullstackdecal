# Deploying Your Website


[source](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/)

## Key Topics

1. **Vercel Overview**
    Deploying you react app is sometimes wonderful feeling, sometimes not. When you first build a react app the Node Modules is confusing, dependencies are daunting, and configs can get really confusing really fast. While when you run it locally, you can shrug off some errors dependency issues, and git ignores, if you try to deploy it those issues may come to haunt you. But the benefits - immense. This overview will show you how to link your github repo to Vercel so that it automatically deploys every time you push!



2. **Common Issues**
    Sub Git Folders

    Dependencies
    
    Git ignore
    
    Configs
    
    

3. **Best Practices (IMPORTANT)**

    Deploy the project initially to vercel so you are not overloaded at the end trying to solve the issues, instead, tackle them as they come up.
    
    Use 
    ```text
    npm run preview
    ```
    
    ```text
    npm run build
    ```
    This is some of the same commands vercel will use to deploy it. By trying it first you can find errors.
    
    If all else fails
    
    1. Clone into a new folder
    ```text
    npm i
    ```
    ```text
    npm run 
    ```
    
    ```text
    npm run build
    ```
