# Lesson 17 - Devops and Cloud

Congratulations on making it this far in the course. So far, we've learned a ton
about different web technologies and how to build awesome, functional websites
using modern web technologies.

Now you're probably wondering - how do I actually get my website to a live URL?
So far in this course, we've been mostly working locally and using a few tools
to deploy our sites, but how do we do this at scale.

Obviously this is a very complex problems, companies like AWS or Google have
spent billions on infrastructure to run platforms and services to support their
applications.

In this lesson, we'll be talking about the fields of Devops (Developer
Operations) and Cloud.

## What is Devops?

Devops is an acronym vgiven to the combination of Development Operations. It's
the philosophy that surrounds ensuring software teams run smoothly, and get
their code built, shipped, and deployed with ease.

When you're building large scale applications, you start to run into a few
questions:

- How do you deploy your code?
- How do you configure your servers so they all work together?
- How do you monitor your deployed services for bugs or errors?
- How do you check performance of your systems?
- How do you plan for and fix problems that come up
- How do you decrease the time spent on development cycles to ensure code is
  deployed products at speed and scale reliably

## Parts of Devops

We'll be talking a bit about some Devops best practices.

Imagine you're a software development team at Facebook releasing software

### Continuous Integration

As a team, you want to ensure that each programmers code is integrated into the
codebase, tested, and validated. This should be done at a regular basis to
ensure there are always new features being pushed. This pracitce is Continuous
IntegratioN (CI).

In industry, software teams build CI pipelines that run tests and check for bugs
to ensure that every contribution to the code base will work properly. This is
done using cloud services, something we'll talk more about.

### Continuous Delivery

Now that your programmers code is tested, you want to deliver your software to
the customer. Continuous Delivery (CD) is the practice of deploying your tested
changes into a testing or production environment after being built.

This means that developers will always have a working build and customers will
always have a working build as fast as possible.

### Microservices

Facebook is a massive company. Having all their services under a single server
would be ridiculous, both in size of code and in complexity. It also would mean
that if this monolith server were to crash, all of Facebook would be down.

Instead, companies use a microservice architecture, a design approach that
breaks up a large application into multiple distributed services. Each service
is ran separately and communicates with other services through a well-defined
API.

For example, a company like Facebook likely has a microservice for
authentication, one for the news feed, etc. This also gives services the
flexibility to be designed and built independently of each other.

### Infrastructure as Code

Code infrastructure, or servers, is managed using code and software techniques
instead of people. We'll talk more about this when we talk about cloud, but this
is crucial to ensuring services remain scalable.

### Conclusion

Devops is crucial for modern software companies to working code efficiently and
consistently.

In this course, we'll go over a few Devops tools

## Beginner Devops Tools

Since we can't cover all the devops tools out there, we'll cover some of the
beginner services that should be immediately helpful for you to deploy your
fullstack applications.

### CI - Github Actions

The most accessible CI tool is
[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). This is an automation
tool that can run scripts or code on each git commit, branch, or pull request.

For example, this is the configuration for a github action that runs a linter on
each commit.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '**'

jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm run ci
      - run: yarn lint
```

### Frontend CD - Vercel or Netliify

Tools like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com) can
automatically deploy your static site frontends to a working website in a few
clicks. These run on each commit, ensuring that your code is always
runnable/deployable.

### Backend CD - Digital Ocean

For deploying a backend server, [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
is a very simple service to deploy a NodeJS backend to a server in a few clicks.
It can hook up to Github so every commit is automatically built and deployed to
the web!

## Deploying your Code

Once you've built your code, you now want to run it somewhere. Of course, you
can run it on your machine, but it's only accessible to you.

Now there's a whole suite of tools to expose your app to the internet or deploy
it to a server (a server is simply a computer) to have it served to the
internet, we talked about this a bit in CD.

However, configuring your own server is costly, challenging, and risky. This is
where cloud comes in.

## The Cloud

To talk about cloud, we'll use an analogy.

Imagine you're traveling to the sahara desert and want to drive on the sand
dunes, but you don't have a car! You can either:

- Buy your own jeep
- Borrow or rent a jeep

Option 1 is similar to buying or maintaining a server yourself. There's a large
upfront cost, you probably won't use it most of the time, and you have to do
maintence yourself if it breaks. This is called _On Premise Computing_.

Option 2 is similar to running your code on the cloud. You can use it for just
the time you want, if something breaks the rental company will fix it, and it's
relatively hands-off. This is called _Cloud Computing_.

Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on
the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a
personal computer.

## Layers of the Cloud

Like all software, there are various layers of abstraction.

### SaaS - Software as a Service

At the highest level, there's Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), like Squarespace or
Weebly. With these tools, you can create and deploy a website all through their
tools, you don't ever have to touch code!

### Paas - Platform as a Service

At the next level, there's Platform as a Service, like Digital Ocean, Netlify,
or Vercel. You control the implementation (code), but don't care about how the
implementation is ran as long as it works.

### IaaS - Infastructure as a Service

This is the lowest level of cloud, like AWS, GCP, or Azure. Here, you can use
hardware that the company manages, meaning you have to deal with the OS, running
the code, etc.

### The Ground

This is buying your own infrastructure (servers) and dealing with all the BS
that comes with hardware. For us webdevs, this is the ickiestt layer.

## Why Cloud (as a business major)?

### Variable Expenses instead of Capital Expenses

- Capital Expense
  - Upfront Costs
  - Pay for servers, server engineers, etc.
  - Variable Expense
- Pay as you go
  - Only pay for what you use
  - Hard to overpay

### Economies of Scale

- You’re not the only one using cloud
  - Servers are shared with thousands to millions of customers
- Thus, cost of servers is also shared
  - Unbeatable savings

### Spend Money on Software, not Hardware

- Lots of money spent not just on servers but the Server Engineers
  - Servers are expensive to run and maintain
  - Server engineers are more expensive
- Spend this money on software instead
  - More bang for you back
  - Greater focus on product

## Why Cloud (as an EECS major)?

### Eliminate Under and Over Utilization

- Use only what you need
  - Similar to Haas Reason #1
  - Pay as you go
- Since you only pay as you go...
  - Don’t overpay for servers you don’t use
  - No more worries about underestimating demand

### Build Faster

- Server time is now just development time
  - On-premise requires set up of OS, virtualization, networking, etc.
  - Also includes setting up and changing hardware
- This can now all be done on the fly
  - Deploy in minutes, not hours

### Immediate Global Deployment

- Handling a global infrastructure is HARD
  - Needs lots of data centers
  - Needs lots of servers
  - Needs a lot of networking
- IaaS Cloud Providers do this for you
  - Go global in minutes, not years

## IaaS -> AWS

The most pouplar IaaS in the world is AWS. AWS provides hundreds of various
services for cloud, from renting full OS's (EC2)

### Why AWS

- Global leader in cloud services
- Has a global network composed of data centers around the world
- Supports an enormous community of software and developer partners
- Has a free tier for developers using applications and services for the first
  time

### Where AWS Exists

Amazon owns a ton of data centers (like over 20 massive ones) and rents out
others in various regions of the world.

For example, they have over 4 data centers in the West Coast alone! These
contain storage and compute that is rented out to people all over the world!

## Conclusion

For the purpose of this class, we won't dive much farther into cloud.

To learn more about AWS, I highly recommend checking out
[this guide](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-nodejs-web-app/)
on deploying a NodeJS app onto Amazon using several of their most popular web
services.

Either way, you should now be able to use PaaS tools like Netlify and Digital
Ocean to deploy your app to production!
