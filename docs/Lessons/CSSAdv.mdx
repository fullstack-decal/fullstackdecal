# Advanced CSS

## Introduction

We'll be discussing three properties of elements that are important for building
a layout using CSS.

- **Position**
- **Display**
- **Float**

## Positioning

Positioning is how elements are placed on the screen relative to other elements
around it.

### Static

Static is the default positioning, where the elements will follow the normal
flow of a web page.

**What's the normal flow?** There are two types of elements inside a webpage:

- **Block boxes** flow **vertically** **downward** starting at the top of their
  containing block and normally takes the full width of the containing “block
  level element” unless otherwise specified. One block element placed directly
  below the preceding block element. Block elements are DIV, P elements.
- **Inline elements** reside in a block level container or inside a block level
  element and they appear side by side in normal flow. If they reach the right
  most wall of container then the inline elements (i.e their box model) wraps to
  next line within the container and stays horizontally.

:::tip

If an element is static, it's not affected by top, bottom, left, and right
properties. It doesn't want to listen to you!

:::

### Relative

An element with `position: relative;` is positioned relative to its default
static position.

By setting `top: 20px;`, the element will be adjusted away from its default
static position and move upward for 20px.

### Fixed

A fixed element is positioned relative to the **viewport**.

The element's position relative to the screen will **not** change even if the
user scrolls.

![Fixed Image](../assets/Lesson4/Lesson4-1.gif)

**Does not leave space** in the page where it would statically have been
located.

Use **top**, **bottom**, **left**, and **right** to place.

### Absolute

An absolute element is positioned relative to the **nearest positioned
ancestor** (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

Can use this to layer on top or under other elements

When there is no explicit positioned ancestor, it uses document body as the
ancestor.

Use higher **z-index** to **layer on top of other elements**.

Use **top**, **bottom**, **left**, and **right** to place.

Gradient background is absolutely positioned.

### Sticky

Sticky is very similar to relative in terms of positioning.

However, when the user scroll to the element, the element will become `fixed`
position and "stick" on the screen.

Essentially toggles between relative and fixed.

Use **top**, **bottom**, **left**, and **right** to place.

Once it hits a position on scroll, it will stick to it.

## Display properties

Elements you create are rendered as boxes on a page. Previously, we looked at
how we can position these boxes on the page, but you can actually do a lot more
with this. That's where the display property comes in.

Display properties describe the type of rendering box around an element. Some of
the different styles we can use include...

- Inline
- Block
- Grid
- Flex
- None

### Inline

Displays an element as an inline element (like span). Any height and width
properties will have **no effect**.

Inline elements are arranged one after the other. Like any othr style, these
elements are contained in boxes that are placed adjacent to one another. A
common use for inline elements is for buttons placed side-by-side.

```css
span {
  /* Span is default inline */
  color: blue;
  font-weight: 700;
  height: 40000px;
}
```

```html
<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>
    This next <span>word</span> here is going to be inline styled! Notice how
    setting the height doesn't make it taller!
  </p>
</body>
```

![Inline Image](../assets/Lesson4/Lesson4-5.png)

### Block

Displays an element as a block element (like p). It starts on a new line, and
takes up the whole width. (**default**) It generates a line break before and
after the block when in normal flow.

:::tip

Notice how there is a gap under "word" due to the height property now being
used! Compare to above example where height is ignored.

:::

```css
span {
  display: block;
  color: blue;
  font-weight: 700;
  height: 40px;
}
```

```html
<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>This next <span>word</span> here is going to be block styled!</p>
</body>
```

### Flexbox (crowd-favorite)

This is the most popular layout option.

Makes it easier to design **flexible responsive layout** structure without
positioning. The main purpose of a flexbox is to fit all elements within the
container by changing the flex dimensions. The flex container can shrink and
stretch as needed, making it very useful in responsive websites where element
sizes change.

A huge benefit of the flexbox is that it is content aware. Different rows
uniquely respond to elements within based on available space. It is
one-dimensional along rows, so it can change item widths without notice of
columns. Take advantage of this by avoiding specifying a width when creating the
CSS for a flexbox. This removes the main flexible purpose of using the flexbox
since items will no longer be dynamic.

The flex-grow propery specifies how items in the flexbox should take up
available space. The value defaults at 0, and it must be specified within a CSS
class specific to the element. This is similar to the flex-wrap property, which
will wrap items To the next line if there are too many elements present in the
container.

You can use the justify-content property to align the elements contained within.
When items are inflexible, it helps with using available space in the flexbox
to align them across the container.

By default, a flexbox attempts to place all elements on the same line. However,
by specifying flex-wrap, you can spread elements across multiple lines.

flexbox alignment can be very confusing. It's important to keep track of your
items since they can stretch and shrink differently based on how you define the
many properties.

Can **specify** direction of flex, spacing, justifying, alignment, etc...

```css
.class {
  display: flex
  flex-direction: row | column | row-reverse | column-reverse
  align-items: flex-start | center | flex-end
  justify-content: flex-start | center | flex-end | space-between | space-around
}
```

### Grid

This is an easy way to lay out your elements in a **grid**. A Grid places the
elements in a two-dimensional matrix. The vertical lines are columns and the
horizontal lines are rows. Using a Grid allows you to change the dimensions of
the columns and rows, making it a strong choice for placing elements. However,
realize that the Grid doesn't have to be a perfect matrix. You can merge columns
at specific rows, wrap content, and give individual items different widths to
customize the layout.

The `display: grid` is one of the newer layout methods in CSS and is very powerful,
however it is also complicated so we recommend only using it when you truly have a
grid of items, and `display: flex` is not good enough.

#### Grid container

A Grid container is the element that contains the items of the Grid. We can
create a Grid container by specifying the display properties (see the example at
the bottom of this section).

#### Grid lines

Grid lines form the grid layout that divides the container into rows and
columns. They can be referenced using an index that starts at 1 from the top
left corner. This means that the first row grid line is index 1 (not 0, unlike
Python and Java arrays/matrices).

#### Grid cells

Grid cells are formed at the intersection of a row and column Grid line. They
are bounded by exactly 2 row lines and 2 column lines to form a box. This is
where you can place elements into the Grid. Grid cells are the smallest possible
unit of space on the Grid

#### Grid area

Grid areas are formed by combining one or more adjacent Grid cells to form a
larger space. Therefore, Grid cells are also Grid areas.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
  background-color: #2196f3;
  padding: 10px;
}
.grid-item {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
  border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 30px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">6</div>
</div>
```

A `display: grid` element has quite a few properties which can be confusing. Here are some
resources to better understand how to use the Grid layout:

- [CSS Grid Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
- [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/)
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

### When to use Grid vs flexbox

When your items are positioned in a single dimension (i.e. all in a straight
vertical/horizontal line), then they can generally operate very similarly. In
this case we recommend using Grid.

The key difference arises in two-dimensional layouts, if you want items to
_fluidly wrap_, then use flexbox with `flex-wrap: wrap`, otherwise, use Grid.

## Float

The `float` property used to be popular back when layout methods like flexbox
and grid didn't exist. Now that they do, `float` isn't used very much because
it's behavior can be confusing.

Float can be either "left" or "right", shifting the element to the left or right
of the container that it is encapsulated in. The rest of the content will be
wrapped around it.

Suppose we had an inline `<img>` nested within a `<p>`. Setting the image's
float property to "right" would place the image to the right of the container
and wrap the text above, to the left of, and below it.

# Cascade and Specificity

CSS stands for "cascading" style sheets. What does "cascading" mean? It's the idea
that an element's style is "cascaded" from various places (its parent element, a
class, the browser's default styling, etc.)

CSS needs to have some rules to figure out which source to use for a given element's
style. In the example below, you can see how the text "span" has two potential sources
for its color: it could inherit its parent `p`'s color, or use the `span` style. In this
example it's pretty obvious how to best resolve this conflict: use the style of the
closest parent, but you can get into more complex cases where it's not as obvious. This
brings us to the next concept of "specificity".

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}

span {
  color: black;
}
```

```html
<p>
  As the body has been set to have a color of blue this is inherited through the
  descendants.
</p>
<p>
  We can change the color by targeting the element with a selector, such as this
  <span>span</span>.
</p>
```

![Cascade Image](../assets/Lesson4/Lesson4-8.png)

:::tip

Order in CSS classes does matter! Whatever comes last in your CSS document is
what stands.

:::

## Specificity

We must be able to handle conflicts and troubleshoot our CSS in a logical way.

Specificity is how specific a certain CSS styling attribute is. To determine
specificity, you can follow this system.

More selector specificity means that it will override the styling of an element
also styled by a less specific CSS selector.

![Specificity Image](../assets/Lesson4/Lesson4-9.png)

:::tip

This convention is not a real CSS rule. It is just for the sake of remembering
the hierarchy.

:::

Here are a few examples:

![Example 1 Image](../assets/Lesson4/Lesson4-10.png)

![Example 2 Image](../assets/Lesson4/Lesson4-11.png)

![Example 3 Image](../assets/Lesson4/Lesson4-12.png)

The **green specificity numbers indicate the styling selector that overrides the
other**.

Notice how the highest number ALWAYS overrides the lowest.

:::tip

Dev tools is great for when this gets confusing! Any overridden styling will
appear with a ~~strikethrough~~.

# Animation and Media Queries

## Pseudo-classes and Animations

A pseudo-class is used to define a **special state** of an element

- _Some examples_: :hover, :focus, :first-child
- _anchor specific tags_: :active, :link, :visited

### transform

One powerful use of pseudo-classes is its cooperation with the **transform**
property

**Example**: size an element up when you hover over it

Other ways to animate are using JS. We will go over these later

### transform + transition

Here’s the syntax:

- In the original element, specify **transition**.
- In the pseudo-class, specify **transform**.

Can **specify** speed, delay, and style of transition.

![Animation Image](../assets/Lesson4/Lesson4-13.png)

## Media Queries

Media queries allow you to change the CSS of the page based on **screen size**.

Change element sizes, change flex direction from row to column, etc...

Can add as many as needed in your CSS file

Can check **width**, **height**, **resolution**, and **orientation** of device.

![Media Image](../assets/Lesson4/Lesson4-14.png)

**Common breakpoints:**

- 320px — 480px: Mobile devices
- 481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets
- 769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops
- 1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens
- 1201px and more — Extra large screens, TV
