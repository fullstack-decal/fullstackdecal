# HW 3 - JavaScript

In this homework, we will be covering the essentials of JavaScript for web
development. Although JavaScript will be presented in this homework as a language
that runs *after* your HTML, adding functionality here and there, it will soon
become the driving force of your website with the introduction of React. For
this reason, you must learn JavaScript well. This homework is designed to give
you a good overview of the most important parts of JavaScript.

## Q0: Read the Notes

JavaScript was designed in a rush, and it shows. It is not a beautiful language.
It is confusing. For this reason, make sure you read all the JavaScript notes
while doing this homework. The JavaScript notes contain a
lesson, [Fundamental JavaScript Concepts](/docs/Lessons/Lesson5), and a
[Review of the Document Object Model (DOM)](/docs/Lessons/Lesson6).

## Q1: Function This

Implement the following function to take a list 
and return the item in the list corresponding to the maximum value in
list after applying `func` to each item.

```js
function max(list, func) {
  var maximum = _____;
  for (var _____ of ______) {
    var _____ = func(_____);
    if (______ >= _____) {
      ______ = ______;
    }
  }
  return maximum;
}
```

## Q2: Flip It and Reverse It

Based on the previous question, in one line, write an anonymous function which,
when passed as `func` to `max` would cause `max` to return the smallest value in
the list.

```js
const reverser = _____;
```

## Q3: What is This?

When objects are created, we use getters to set their initial values. Getters allow us to access value of the object
during initialization. In the following function, complete the getter to compute the Euclidean distance between **(a, b)** and **(x, y)**

```js
class Point {
    constructor(x, y) {
        // Initialize the point with the given x and y coordinates
    }
    distance(p) {
        return Math.sqrt(
            // return the Euclidean distance between this point and point p
            // hint: Euclidean distance is given by sqrt((a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2)
        )
    }
}
```

## Q4: Objects Gworl

**Warning: Read the following spec very carefully**

We want to create a general purpose function to keep records. We pass a JavaScript
object, key, and value to our function, and in return, our function should do
the following:

- If the current value of the item at `key` is a singular item, update the `key`
  to correspond to `value`
- If the current value of the item at `key` is a list, append `value` to the
  list
- If the current value of the item at `key` is another JSON object, create a new
  entry using `key` as the key and `value` as the value

```js
function changer(object, key, value) {
  var ______ = ______;
  if (Array.isArray(prev)) {
    ______;
  } else if (typeof prev == 'object' && prev != null) {
    ______ = ______;
  } else {
    ______ = ______;
  }
  return null;
}
```

## Q5: Promises Promises

In this function, we want to print the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` in numerical
order. Using Promises, fill in the function to print numbers in the correct
order

```js
async function promise_me(truthy) {
    const a = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        console.log(_____)
        ______(______)
    })
    console.log(2)
    console.log(3)
    console.log(4)
    const five = ______ ______
    console.log(five)
    return five
}
```
