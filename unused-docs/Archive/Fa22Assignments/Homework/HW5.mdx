# HW 5 - Advanced React

While we've worked on basic React sites that are static, real world applications
interact with servers and databases over the internet. In ths homework, we'll be
tieing together the frontend and the backend aspects of this course.

## Learning Objectives 

- Further practice with React syntax
- Introduce Axios
- Use HTTP methods to access RESTful services
- Create your first custom hook
- Use fetched data to create a dynamic application

## Setup

The starter code for this homework is in Classroom:

[Homework 5](https://classroom.github.com/a/bEYzWDu3)

Take a look around the codebase and try to understand how it's put together.

## Task 1 - Start the Backend

Before we start building anything, we have to set up our server first. For this
instance we will be using Express. The server will already be pre-built for you,
feel free to look to examine the code and don't stress if you don't understand
it. You'll only be worrying about the React side of things:

- cd into the directory: `cd homework5-starter/node-server`
- Install dependencies: `npm i`
- Run the server: `npm start`

You should see output that looks something like this:

```shell
❯ npm start

> node-server@1.0.0 start
> node index.js

Block Server listening at http://localhost:3002
```

## Task 2 - Start the Frontend

Congrats! The backend server is now running at `localhost:3001`. Now for a
production application, we'd also often be running a database such as MongoDB,
but if you examine the code, you'll see that we've hard-coded the data you're
fetching.

For this task, we'll introduce fetching data from a server from our frontend.

As you know, we can use HTTP requests to send and receive data over the
internet. In fact, opening a website like `google.com` is an HTTP GET request!
Servers are similar, they have various routes that contain HTTP endpoints that
you can trigger.

By default, browsers have the `fetch` API built in to give your frontend
javascript the ability to fetch resources across a network. You can read more
about Fetch [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

While fetch is incredibly powerful, it's also a bit more barebones and complex,
so we'll be using a wrapper around Fetch called
[Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).

First, lets install Axios:

```shell
npm install axios
```

And now lets start the app:

```npm
npm start
```

:::info Make sure that your express server and React app are on different ports.
:::

## Task 3 - Write an API request

Now that your frontend and backend are working, lets write a HTTP request.

First, lets see how Axios works in an example:

```jsx live
function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useState();

  const getPostsData = () => {
    axios
      .get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts') //THIS IS YOUR URL OF YOUR API
      .then((data) => setData(data.data)) //PROMISE API, THAT MEANS WHEN YOU GET THE DATA WHAT DO I DO WITH IT
      .catch((error) => console.log(error)); //ERROR CATCHING IN CASE WE RECEIVE AN ERROR
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getPostsData();
  }, []);

  return <p>{data ? JSON.stringify(data[0]) : 'loading'}</p>;
}
```

In this example, our function `getPostsData` calls the API using a `GET`
request. This function is called in a `useEffect` hook on first render. We then
wait for the promise resolve using a `.then`, and once resolved, set our state
variable `data` to the returned data. We also catch the error if the promise
returns an error.

Confused by the hooks? As a reminder,

- useEffect hooks run the function passed into the first parameter if any
  variable in the array passed in as the second parameter changes.
  - In this example, there are no variables passed in the second arg, so this
    will run when the component first mounts (is rendered)
- useState hold pieces of state, and a `setState` call will trigger a component
  re-render

Cool, now that you know any example of how we might fetch data, how might you
use this data to render out posts in our application?

### Action Items

In `Feed.js`, fill in the blanks to make an API request. Fetch data from our server (`http://localhost:3002/posts`) and render out each
array item using the `Post` component inside of the `Feed` component. (You can leave line 50 as a blank for now!)

**Tips:**

- Make sure your server URL is passed in the get logic correctly
- Where would the fetch logic be placed?

## Task 4 - Creating a new post

Now that we can view posts from our server, you'll notice that there's a form at
the bottom to create a new post. We've already built the logic to get the form
data, you'll be using a post request to add this data to our server.

Axios post requests are very simple, as an example:

```js
axios
  .post(url, data) // `url` is the url to post to, `data` is the data to send in the body of the HTTP request
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

### Action Item

1. In `Feed.js`, fill in the blank in line 50. Pass in a function to a `NewPost` component through a prop.
2. In `NewPost.js`, fill in the blanks for creating a new post by making a `POST` request.
3. Fill in the blank in line 4 to accept the passed in property and use that property after the post request.

**Tips**

- To create a new post, you'll have to `POST` /post

## Task 5 - Working with Comments

At this point, you should be able to view and create new posts. Now, we'll do
the same for comments.

There's a `comments` field on the server data, and if you `POST`
`/post/:id/comment`, you'll be able to add a new comment.

### Action Item

1. Fill in the blanks in `Comments.js` to handle and submit the new comment.
2. Fill in the blanks in `Post.js` to pass in correct props to `Comments` component.

**Tips**
- In `.then` body, change the states to reflect the new comment and clear the `newComment` state.


## Submission

After you finish, push these changes into your Classroom repository.

1. Turn your code into Gradescope for the assignment **Homework 5**.
2. This assignment has a **checkoff** component. To get credit,
you must get checked off. You may get checked off at any TA office hour,
or you may come to HWP on Friday and get checked off there. Homework is
*due* on Friday, November 4, 2022 at 11:59 PM PST, which means that you
must submit to Gradescope by then. You must then get checked off by the following
Friday, November 11, 2022.


### Demo of Solution

When finished, your website should be able to run like the follow:

<iframe
  src="https://www.loom.com/embed/843dd029aa584d1398b129145b8d5968"
  frameborder="0"
  webkitallowfullscreen
  mozallowfullscreen
  allowfullscreen
  style={{ height: '300px' }}
/>

Note the UI doesn't have to be the same.
