# Fullstack Lab

For this lab, we will be reviewing an example of a fullstack website with frontend, backend, and all of the necessary components for 
a production grade website. This website, called _Up and Coming_ was a final project
created in the very first iteration of this course. Here, we have provided is as an
example of what a complete website, and a complete final project, should look like.

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS
- React
- MongoDB

To install any of these, please visit the documentation.

## Cloning the Repository

This project consists of two different repositories.
One repository contains the frontend code and the other contains the backend code.
For your own project, you may choose to separate frontend and backend into two repositories,
or you may use one repository and organize two separate directories in that single repository.

In order to give you access to play around with the code, please **fork** each repository. 
To fork, visit the following links:

- Frontend: https://github.com/WDB-Project/frontend
- Backend: https://github.com/WDB-Project/backend 

**_Fork_** the repository to your own account. Once it has been forked to your account, clone it to your local machine.
The rest of this lab will be completed locally.

## Database Setup

This project uses a database to store users. Because it runs the database locally,
you must setup the database beforehand in for it to work.

First ensure that you have MongoDB (Community Edition) is installed.
Into your terminal, enter the following:

```
mongo
use upandcoming
```

`mongo` should start up the mongo shell and `use upandcoming` will create the
necessary database. If successful, you should see `switched to db upandcoming`

## Starting up

To actually start the website, we will be running the frontend and backend in parallel.
Because they are built with different softwares, this example runs them as separate entities,
accessible via separate ports. Our frontend will literally make HTTP requests to 
our backend. As such, they must run on separate ports.

For this project, the frontend runs on localhost:3000 and the backend on localhost:3030

To actually spin up, first open a terminal. `cd` into the `frontend` repository, 
and into the terminal type 

```
yarn start
```

Now, open a new terminal. **DO NOT interrupt the previous terminal**. Both terminals
must run at the _same_ time. `cd` into the `backend` respository, and type:

```
node server.js
```

Now, both components should be working correctly. 

## Explore

The premise of this website was to serve as a volunteer social media.
Individuals could sign up to volunteer, create and browse events, and keep track
of what events they have attended this year. Feel free to play with the website, 
and ensure that you are continuously looking back at the code to understand what is 
going on.
