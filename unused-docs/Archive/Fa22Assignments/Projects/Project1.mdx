# Project One - Personal Website

## Introduction

For this project, we will be creating a standard part of every designer + developer's portfolio: a personal website.
A personal website is an important part of demonstrating your skills and passions as a developer to the world.
A beautiful personal website can reel people in and keep them engaged with all of your amazing work!

We're going to use our newfound HTML and CSS skills to create website layouts
and style them into beautiful personal portfolios. By the end of this project, you'll have a brand new personal
website and your own corner of the world wide web.

## Part 0: Starter Code

We have provided only a blank index.html and styles.css file for you.
Since this is a project, no template code will be provided. We encourage you to look back at past assignments
to get a sense for how we set up a project and connect up its components.

## Part 1: Introduction to Design

Because our website is primarily frontend, we will start our development process with a introductory
look at design. We will go into much more depth later in the semester, but for now, this is a chance
to try out your own design processes and ideas. This is **your** website, so you are more than welcome
to make it look however you'd like.

Before we can start prototyping, it is important to have a clear design vision.
To develop in the most efficient and effective way, we want to template what our website should look like,
and make all of the difficult and wonderful design decisions before we try implementing them.

Try templating out some of your ideas on paper. We have not covered how to use Figma yet, so you are not expected
to use that, but see if you can try _wireframing_ your website out first.

> Wireframing is a process where designers draw overviews of interactive products to establish the structure
> and flow of possible design solutions.
> These outlines reflect user and business needs.
> Paper or software-rendered wireframes help teams and stakeholders ideate toward optimal,
> user-focused prototypes and products
>

It will make frontend development much less painful if you have a roadmap for yourself.

Below, we have included a few links to example design templates that you are more than welcome to use:

[Figma Templates](https://www.figma.com/file/l8wZgVAFvc4cyVynEGmYUI/WDB-Project-1-Site-Templates?node-id=0%3A1)

We have also included links to personal websites of several WDB developers. Note that these are very
advanced websites, and we are not looking for anything more elaborate than the provided templates,
though you are welcome to take it as far as you'd like.

## Part 2: Requirements

This project is largely left open-ended. The goal is to give you the freedom to explore and produce
something that you will actually use!

There are some requirements to ensure that you are grasping the content so far, but they will
not be nearly as stringent as the homework.

How you choose to do make your personal website will be entirely up to you since
there will be multiple ways to accomplish the same thing. That being said there
will still be some guidelines and set of restrictions that you should abide by:

- **Content** There are 3 sections you _must_ include within the website:
  - _About_: A short introduction on who you are and what you bring to the
    table.
  - _Work_: Some examples of work that you have done that you want to showcase.
    This could include past projects that you have worked on, current
    projects that you are currently doing, class projects, internships, and
    clubs!
  - _Contact:_ A section where potential site-visitors could find your social
    media handles, and an email or phone number to contact you.
- **HTML**
  - One use of each type of header `<h1>`-`<h6>`
  - One use of `<div>` with `flex` layout. **Hint:** flex is useful for adding arbitrarily many containers into a space.
  - One use of `<div>` with `grid` layout. **Hint:** grid is useful for aligning and laying out several similar containers.
  - One use of `<a>`. This must be set to open in a new tab.
  - One use of `<img>`
  - One use of `<button>`. The button can do anything.
  - One use of `<title>` and `<author>`. **Hint:** this should go in the `<head>`
  - One functional component. This should be something quirky that shows off your knowledge. It should be a form input
    that triggers some JavaScript function. It does not have to do something that is necessarily useful,
    it only has to do something. This will be graded on the following component:
    - Use of JavaScript from a `<script>` tag
    - Use of a `<form>` component, with a `<label>` and `<input>` (can be of any input type).
    - Use of a `<submit>` button.
- **CSS**
  - `*` selector
  - `.[class]` selector
  - `#[id]` selector
  - `:hover` pseudoselector
  - `font` property
- **Style Check** The code you write must be readable and efficient (eg. sensible and self-documenting
  names, appropriate use of CSS classes, etc...)

## Submission

Please publish your code to GitHub Pages so that we can see it. If you would like to keep this codebase
to publish to your own personal GitHub Pages you can _fork_ the repository. Forking the repository essentially
creates a copy of the repository in your personal account.

In the `README.md` please include a link to the GitHub Pages link hosted at `fullstack-decal-fa22.github.io`

Submit your code to Gradescope via the Classroom repository.

- Gradescope will run an autograder to ensure that you have all the correct components and have included the link.
- This assignment will **also be hand graded**. We will be providing feedback in the Gradescope comments
  to help you improve your websites.

## Conclusion

Now that you have a personal website, you have officially become a web developer ðŸŽ‰!
This is now your space to showcase all your hard work as you continue on in your career, your little corner of the Internet.
As you continue on and learn more in this class, we hope that you'll fork it and revisit this website and keep improving on it.
It is a reflection of your incredible ability as a developer and we'd love to see where you take it!
