# HW 5 - Node.js & MongoDB

## Introduction

In this homework, we will utilize the NASA daily picture API to create a backend
server that allows users to store, delete, and retrieve their favorite
pictures of planets and nebulas.


## The API

Here is the NASA Open APIs Website:

[NASA Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/)

We will be using the APOD API to retrieve the pictures that we are going to store. To do so, please familiarize yourself with the API and its endpoints.
We will need these later as we write our own API to interface with the NASA API (yes, APIs can be used to read from other APIs). 

## Goal

The goal is to build an Express.js server that reads and writes to a MongoDB database.
This will allow the user to store or delete any "Astronomy Picture of the Day" from NASA and view
all their favorite ones in a list format.

## Instructions

Before we dig into it, be sure to pull the assignment repository down from GitHub. Note that for this asignment, 
the repository is empty. This is because we will be going over starter code as part of the written instructions here.

1. Navigate to https://classroom.github.com/a/8yZbCLq8
2. Accept the assignment. Once the repository has been generated, navigate to repository, and clone it onto your local machine.

### Database Setup

We need to ensure that MongoDB is installed on our machine first. To install MongoDB Community Edition on your machine, 
follow the instructions [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/).

We will be creating a database called `apod` to store our entries. To create this database on our machine,
we will use the mongo shell, a very convenient utility for peeking into our machine's mongo databases.

On your machine's command line, we will do the following:

1. Enter the shell with `mongo`
2. Initialize our `apod` database with `use`

Into the command line, type the following
```
mongo
use apod
exit
```

You should get a message that says `switched to db apod`. This signifies that our database has been created correctly.

Once MongoDB is installed and our database initialized, we need a tool to communicate between our Express server and our MongoDB databse.
For this, we use an NPM package called [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose).

Navigate to your assignment repository, and once _inside_ the repository, we will install the necessary packages.

```js
npm init
npm install express
npm install mongoose
```

Now, create a `server.js` file and open it. 

To use mongoose, we must import the module and establish the connection.

In `server.js`, we need the following:

```
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const db = mongoose.connection
const url = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/apod"

mongoose.connect(url, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true })
```

This creates a connection to our APOD database (hosted on our local machine at port 27017), for mongoose to talk to.

Finally, we need to create a Schema for mongoose to use to store our data in it's model object.

```
const Schema = mongoose.Schema
const apodSchema = Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  url: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  rating: {
    type: Integer,
    required: true
  }
}, {collection: 'images'})

const APOD = mongoose.model('APOD', apodSchema)
```

### Express Setup

We must now setup Express before we continue with writing to our database. 

To setup Express, we need to initialize our app object.

```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.use(express.json())
app.use(express.urlencoded())

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

// CODE GOES Here

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

### API Development

Now, let us define the routes that we are going to be using to read and write to our API.

We will be using the following routes to define our functionality.

```
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  // GET "/" should return a list of all APOD images stored in our database
});

app.get("/favorite", function (req, res) {
  // GET "/favorite" should return our favorite image by highest rating
});

app.post("/add", function (req, res) {
  // POST "/add" adds an APOD image to our database
});

app.delete("/delete", function (req, res) {
  // DELETE "/delete" deletes an image according to the title
});
```

### Database Functions

Here is an example of how to implement the functions by database query. 
```jsx
app.get("/favorite", function (req, res) {
  // GET "/favorite" should return our favorite image by highest rating
    APOD.find().sort({'rating': 'desc'}).exec((error, images) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error)
      res.send(500)
    } else {
      res.json({favorite: images[0]})
    }
  })
})
```

The rest of the endpoints are for you to implement. Here are some tips to help you.

### Tips

1. POST and DELETE methods do not have to send data back. Only a confirmation of successful implementation.
2. [mongoose documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) 
You may find the Queries section helpful, specifically `.find()` and `.deleteOne()`. To create, you may find Models helpful, 
specifically `.save()`

### Checkpoint

Your file should look like this

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

app.use(express.json())
app.use(express.urlencoded())

const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const db = mongoose.connection
const url = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/apod"

mongoose.connect(url, { useUnifiedTopology: true, useNewUrlParser: true })

const Schema = mongoose.Schema
const apodSchema = Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  url: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  rating: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  }
}, {collection: 'images'}) \\ Note that within our DB, we are storing these images in a collection called images. 

const APOD = mongoose.model('APOD', apodSchema)

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  // GET "/" should return a list of all APOD images stored in our database
});

app.get("/favorite", function (req, res) {
  // GET "/favorite" should return our favorite image by highest rating
    APOD.find().sort({'rating': 'desc'}).exec((error, images) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error)
      res.send(500)
    } else {
      res.json({favorite: images[0]})
    }
  })
})

app.post("/add", function (req, res) {
  // POST "/add" adds an APOD image to our database
});

app.delete("/delete", function (req, res) {
  // DELETE "/delete" deletes an image according to the title
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

### Testing

To test your code, we highly encourage you to use Postman. Postman is a very thorough backend testing service, 
that we use to send structured queries to our APIs. Here, we are hosting our API at `http://localhost:3000/`. 

Because this is a local API, you will need to download the Postman Desktop Agent.

Once you have done that successfully, you can make requests as you heart desires.

First, navigate to the collections tab, and create a new collection "Homework 5".
Now, let us add a new request.

#### Testing GET "/"
1. Next to the name of your collection in the sidebar, click the three dots and click `add new request`. 
2. Title the request "Test Simple GET"
3. Set the URL to be `http://localhost:3000/`
4. Hit send.
5. If the API is working correctly, you should get a list of all the images you saved to the API. If not
keep debugging, and use Postman to test continuously.

#### Testing POST "/add"
1. Again, add a new request and an appropriate title
2. Set the URL to be `http://localhost:3000/add/"
3. This is a POST, so we need a body. Go to body, then set it to raw. Finally, change text to JSON. 
4. Write your payload 
```
{
  "title": "Hello World",
  "url": "example.com",
  "rating": 5
}
```

The rest of the functions can be tested in a similar manner
