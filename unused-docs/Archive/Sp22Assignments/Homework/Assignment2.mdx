# HW2 - CSS

## Introduction

CSS is important because it allows web designers, developer, bloggers, and so
forth to make our websites **unique** and **attractive**. CSS gives us the
opportunity to play with a page layout, adjust colors and fonts, add effects to
images, etc.

## Part 0: Read the Notes

Make sure you read the [Introductory CSS](/docs/Lessons/Lesson3) reading before
getting started on this homework. The [Advanced CSS](/docs/Lessons/Lesson4)
reading will also be very useful.

## Your Tasks For This Assignment

1. Recreate four flags from various countries using your new knowledge of HTML
   and CSS.
2. Given an unstyled HTML file, add CSS to it accordingly to make it match an
   image.

## Task One: Flags of the World

### 1. Set up your file structure

- **Step One:** The starter code for this homework is here:
  https://github.com/fullstack-decal/sp22-assignment2-starter.git

- **Step Two:** Import the CSS stylesheet into the HTML document.
  - You should be using something like this:
    `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />`

### 2. Skeleton Code Walkthrough

**HTML File**

- All flags are organized inside the `insideborder` div.
  - The `insideborder` is a flexbox with a flex-direction column.
- We have provided the Poland flag as an example
  ```html
  <div class="flag">
    <div class="white twovert"></div>
    <div class="red twovert"></div>
  </div>
  ```
  - `flag` is a container that has a width of 500px & a height of 300px
  - `twovert` is a class that has 50% height, the class creates the upper &
    lower division of the flagg.
  - `red` and `white` are two classes that provide the background color to the
    divisions.

## Task Two: Season Your Site

### Required

1. Inside the HTML document, you need to recreate and display the following
   flags:

   1. Luxembourg
   2. Thailand
   3. Romania
   4. Mexico _Hint: Grab the Eagle using an image tag_
      - Here's the eagle image:
        ![flag_eagle.png](../assets/Assignment2/Assignment2-1.png)
   5. Greece _Hint: you need a LOT OF flexboxs_

### Optional

These are some challenges for you, they are entirely optional.

1.  South Africa
2.  Seychelles
3.  North Macedonia
4.  Finland _Hint: Google CSS properties that would allow you to rotate or
    superimpose objects_

5.  In your CSS stylesheet, make sure to create and reuse classes (a lot of
    flags share similarities). Within your stylesheet, you should use at least 5
    classes and 2 IDs, although you will certainly use more than that. In
    addition, use the wildcard operator and at least 2 tag selectors (h1, p,
    etc…)
    1.  Don't stress too much on colors or sizes, A close enough will work just
        as fine!
    2.  Remember that google is your friend and that there is a multitude of CSS
        properties out there.
6.  Don't forget to enjoy your creative freedom and make the website as visually
    pleasing as you can! Aim to use as many different CSS properties as
    possible, spanning as many types or “buckets” as you can. Feel free to
    explore and use any interesting CSS properties!

- Bonus Challenge: try to find a cool CSS property that we haven't seen before!

## Submission

After you finish, push these changes onto your WDB-education repository.

Turn your code into a GitHub pages link, and upload the link to your page to
Gradescope. The Gradescope can be found on the syllabus, and instructions for
creating a GitHub page link can be found at the end of homework 1.
