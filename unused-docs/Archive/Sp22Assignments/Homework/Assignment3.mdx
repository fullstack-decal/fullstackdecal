# HW 3 - JavaScript

In this homework, we will be covering the essentials of JavaScript for web
development. JavaScript, unlike many other languages, was specifically designed
to make web development easier and more powerful. This homework will touch on
both the normal structures of the language, like what you would learn in the
first few weeks of 61A, and also on the language-specific features of
JavaScript. This homework is **hard**. Do not be afraid to ask for help. This
homework is designed to challenge you to understand the nuances of JavaScript.
Do not be discouraged if you do not understand it immediately.

## Part 0: Read the Notes

Make sure you read all the JavaScript notes while doing this homework. While you
don't need to read all of the JavaScript notes in order to start this homework,
the problems here touch upon all of the JavaScript content at some point. We do,
however, recommend starting before we've gone over all of the JavaScript content
so you can get a head start on the homework. The JavaScript notes contain a
lesson, [Fundamental JavaScript Concepts](/docs/Lessons/Lesson5), a
[Review of the Document Object Model (DOM)](/docs/Lessons/Lesson6), and
[Async and Scope Concepts](/docs/Lessons/Lesson7).

## Q1: Function This

Implement the following function to take an iterable (essentially a list of
things) and return the item in the list corresponding to the maximum value in
list after applying `key` to each item.

```js
function max(iterable, key) {
  var maximum = _____;
  for (var _____ in ______) {
    var _____ = key(_____);
    if (______ >= _____) {
      ______ = ______;
    }
  }
  return maximum;
}
```

## Q2: Flip It and Reverse It

Based on the previous question, in one line, write an anonymous function which,
when passed as `key` to `max` would cause `max` to return the smallest value in
the list.

```js
const reverser = _____;
```

## Q3: What is This?

## THIS QUESTION IS INCORRECT AND WILL NOT BE GRADED.

## Q4: Objects Gworl

**Warning: Read the following spec very carefully**

We want to create a general purpose function to keep records. We pass a JSON
object, key, and value to our function, and in return, our function should do
the following:

- If the current value of the item at `key` is a singular item, update the `key`
  to correspond to `value`
- If the current value of the item at `key` is a list, append `value` to the
  list
- If the current value of the item at `key` is another JSON object, create a new
  entry using `key` as the key and `value` as the value

```js
function changer(object, key, value) {
  var ______ = ______;
  if (Array.isArray(prev)) {
    ______;
  } else if (typeof prev == 'object' && prev != null) {
    ______ = ______;
  } else {
    ______ = ______;
  }
  return null;
}
```

## Q5: Promises Promises

In this function, we want to print the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` in numerical
order. Using Promises, fill in the function to print numbers in the correct
order

```js
async function promise_me(truthy) {
    const a = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        console.log(_____)
        ______(______)
    })
    console.log(2)
    console.log(3)
    console.log(4)
    const five = ______ ______
    console.log(five)
    return five
}
```
