# HW4 - React

## Introduction

One of the reasons the React framework is so powerful is that instead of updating the entire 
HTML website every time you change a component, you can simply just update that singular component,
without having other parts of the website realize it! In this homework, 
we will be using that notion and the idea of Components to create our own implementation of that.

For this assignment, you will be making your own version of Tic Tac Toe using React Components! 

## Part 0: Read through Lesson 8 and Example 8.5

Make sure you read the [React 1](/docs/Lessons/Lesson9) notes before getting
started on this homework. Additionally, [Example 8.5](/docs/Lessons/Lesson9-2)
goes through how to make Tic Tac Toe using Class Components in React. For this assignment, 
you will be working with functional components, but it is still worth checking out this 
lesson to get a better understanding of the logic and overall structure of a React Project.

## Setup

For this homework, we are using Github Classroon. The starter code link is here: https://classroom.github.com/a/DRVJTOio. Follow the instructions from Project 2 on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kz3kpbg3z8j57?cid=76). 


### Starting a server on localhost

In order to see your changes in a brower, you need to start a local server. 
- cd into the directory: `cd homework4-{your_username}`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the server: `npm start`

```shell
❯ npm start

> node-server@1.0.0 start
> node index.js

Block Server listening at http://localhost:3000
```

### Setting up the project to deploy with Github Pages

There are a few extra steps you need to go through in order to host your Tic Tac Toe website through Github Pages.

1. In your `package.json`, add a `homepage` property

``` jsx
{
  "name": "hw4-starter",
  "version": "0.1.0",
+ "homepage": "https://fullstack-decal.github.io/homework4-{your_username}",
  "private": true,

```

2. Add deployment scripts to your `package.json`

``` jsx 

"scripts": {
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -b main -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",

```

## Requirements

### 1. Use Functional Components to split up the logic

The starter code we give has already broken down the game into three components: 
Game, Board, and Square. Make sure to use functional components in your solution. 
We have already provided a skeleton on how to create functional components in React.

### 2. useState Hook

Implement the logic and state of the game with `useState` hooks. 
This is how we regulate state in React functional components.

### 3. Optional: Keep track of history of moves

For each click on a sqaure, make sure to keep track of the player that clicked on the square 
and which sqaure was clicked (numbered 1-9). Display this list of moves on your page.


## Submission

Push your Tic Tac Toe solution to your repository. Run `npm run deploy` from your project directory to run both the `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts. 
When you navigate to https://fullstack-decal.github.io/homework4-{your_username}, you should be able to see the website you made with React! Submit this link to Gradescope. Make sure to follow all setup instructions to see your webiste.
