# About Guides

Guides are readings we've created that aren't associatted with a lecture this semeseter. We've created these guides as supplemental material to commonly asked questions, topics that we would want to teach but don't have the time to, or just extra pieces of reading we think contain good-to-know knowledge. If you're interested in seeing a guide that isn't covered here or in the readings, let us know!
