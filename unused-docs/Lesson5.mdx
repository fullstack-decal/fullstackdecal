# JavaScript 1: Basic JavaScript

## Programming Fundamentals

This is a tough section to teach because the needs of the student vary quite
widely here. Some of you are Computer Science or Data Science majors who already
know multiple programing languages. Some of you are totally new to coding and
JavaScript will be your first programming language. Just like you know Spanish
already, learning Italian becomes a whole lot easier since you take the same
concepts and express them with minor variances. Our curriculum is meant for
those totally new to coding and thus we assume no prior knowledge. If you do
know another programming language or have taken an introductory programming
course such as CS 61A or Data 8, feel free to instead to skim this section in
familiarize with how JavaScript looks.

## What is code???

A dumb question but its answer may surprise you. Code is for humans first and
computers second. You can think of writing code as essentially writing notes on
how to solve a particular problem that just happens to be in a way that computer
can understand it.

Wait, why? The why is because you or someone else will have to go back and
re-read that code sometime in the future, maybe tomorrow or maybe in ten years.
As such, it's important to write code in a such way that it's easily
understandable to someone with little context. You will spend far longer
maintaining this code than you will be writing it the first time. Be explicit.
Be deliberate. The point here is not to be clever but to be simple and to
communicate clearly. Code is communication.

Okay, given this, let's frame how this code works then. When you write code, the
computer breaks it down into smaller pieces it can understand and then executes
those one bit at a time. With JavaScript, only one thing is ever happening at a
time (this is called being _single-threaded_ but that is not a term you need to
know.) In general, this means it executes line 1, then line 2, then line 3, etc.
Let's see that in action:

```jsx
const monthlyRent = 500;

const yearlyRent = monthlyRent * 12;
console.log(yearlyRent);
```

**Result**

```jsx
6000;
```

The first thing that happens above is that we declare a variable, `monthlyRent`.
The `const` keyword is how we let JavaScript know we're declaring a variable.
Variable names cannot have spaces in them, which is why we squish the
words "monthly rent" together. In order to make this more readable, we use
what's called _camel casing_ (because the capital letters in the
middle make it look like humps on a camel). Some people like to use underscores e.g.
`monthly_rent` which is cool too, but in JavaScript the convention is camel-case.

Notice the `;` at the end of every line. This semicolon lets JavaScript know
you've finished the statement. Semicolons are optional in JavaScript (some languages like
C require them). Since they are optional, there is a passioante debate about whether or not
you should use them. For this course, we don't mind but the writer personally likes
to use them.

Variable can be called _almost_ anything. They can consist of any letter, number, underscore, or `$`,
however they cannot _start_ with a number. You **can't** use keywords. An
example would be `const const = 15`. `const` is a keyword so it can't be used as a
variable name.

You do want to give your variables good names. Imagine we have a
huge file and 200 lines below we see the variable named `monthlyRent`: we'll
know instantly what this variable does and we won't have to go try to read the
code to figure it out. _Always, always, always use good variable names_.
Seriously. Put time into it. Naming things is hard and it's a big part of your
job.

Okay, so after line one, I have a variable named `monthlyRent` that I can use as
much as I want. In this case, it represents the number of `500` but it also
semantically represents monthlyRent. Imagine if I had 1000 lines between
where `monthlyRent` is declared and where `yearlyRent` is calculated. I could
have just put `500` directly in `yearlyRent` but I don't because I now
understand how that's calculated just by reading the code. Use variables. Use
them everywhere. It makes your code way easier to read. Also, later, if my
monthly rent changes, I can change it one place and everywhere I
reference `monthlyRent` gets updated automatically. Powerful stuff.

Okay, I think calculate `yearlyRent`. I use the `*` to represent multiplication.
I'm also mixing variables and numbers which is just fine. I also could have
said `const yearlyRent = monthlyRent * monthsInAYear;` (assuming I
put `const monthsInAYear = 12;` somewhere else) too and that would be a good
idea. I would argue the two are roughly the same since it's obvious there are 12
months in a year. But you do what you think is most clear. That's your job.

`console.log(yearlyRent);` is going to print whatever is stored
in `yearlyRent` to the JavaScript console. The JavaScript Console is a part of
the dev tools. If you need help finding
them, [see here](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-do-i-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers).
We'll explain how it works in a bit but for now just know that anything you put
between the parenthesises gets logged out to your JavaScript console.

Let's get this little snippet working in our browser. Make a new folder (I'll
just a put it on my desktop) and add an index.html file with the following in
it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript Experiments</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>JavaScript Experiments!</h1>
    <script src="./experiments.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

That script tag is going to let us load JavaScript code into out HTML page. So
make another file in the same folder called experiments.js (it really can be
called anything as long as the script tag matches it.) Then in the that JS file
put our code from above:

```jsx
const monthlyRent = 500;

const yearlyRent = monthlyRent * 12;
console.log(yearlyRent);
```

**Result**

```jsx
6000;
```

Now, if you open your HTML file, not the JS file, in your browser and open your
console, you should see the number 6000 being printed. Congrats! You just wrote
your first code!

## Python to Javascript

The easiest way (for me at least) to learn a programming language is to directly
compare the conventions of a different programming language and directly apply
it to the new programming language. For example, things like functions, lists,
variables, and so on and so forth. Since a majority of you are taking or have
taken CS 61A or Data 8, we'll be using python as that language of comparison.

## Statements

Let's take this simple python code for example:

```python
x = 5
y = 6
z = x + y
```

In Javascript, the following code would look like this:

```jsx
let x, y, z;
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
```

Notice how we have to _declare_ our variables first in JavaScript.
The `let` statement let's us do just that. We can also declare and assign a
variable at the same time like so:

```jsx
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
```

## Syntax and Convention

In JavaScript you declare variables using the `let` or `const` keyword. A variable declared
`const` cannot be modified. You only use `let` or `const` when first declaring the variable,
after the variable is declared, you do not include a keyword to set it:

```jsx
let myNumber = 1;
myNumber = 2; // OK

const myNumber = 1;
myNumber = 2; // ERROR
```

:::tip

You may see the `var` keyword in old code. The `var` keyword is similar to `let` but
has weaker semantics. Specifically, the `let` keyword defines variables only in the
block that they are defined. This prevents your variables from leaking/modifying things
they shouldn't.

tldr, use `let` over `var`, but they mean similar things.

:::

```jsx
let myNumber = 420;
let myFloat = 4.2;
let myString = "Hello, World!";
let Mystring = "Hello, World again!"; // Different than the above.
```

To have a line that is a "comment", that is code that is ignored by JavaScript, you use `//`

```jsx
let myInt = 420; // This code is executed
let myFloat = 4.2; // This code is executed
// let myString = "420"; // This code is NOT
// let myString = '420'; // This code is NOT
```

We recommending adding as many comments as possible to explain how your code works
and why you chose to structure it a certain way.

## Types

### Strings

So far we've just dealt with numbers. Let's go further and start working with
words and characters. In programming, we refer to these things are strings, as
in a string of one-letter characters. An example of this would be

```jsx
const myName = "Ben Awad";
```

You can see I use the " (double quote) to enclose everything I want to be in the
string. In JavaScript you can also use ' (single quote) and ` (back tick) as
well to demarcate strings.

Strings, as you may imagine, are everywhere in programming. We're constantly
keeping track of names, addresses, names of products, cities, etc. and thus
constantly need strings.

Let's go further. Strings let you connect them together through string
concatenation. If I want to be able to greet someone based on their name, I
might have something like this:

```jsx
const firstName = "Jonathan";
const lastName = "Ma";

const sentence = "Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName + "! How are you!?";
const sentenceWithTemplate = `Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}! How are you!?`;

console.log(sentence);
console.log(sentenceWithTemplate);
```

**Result**

```jsx
"Hello Jonathan Ma! How are you!?";
"Hello Jonathan Ma! How are you!?";
```

The first way is the old way. We can use the `+` to tell JavaScript to connect
two strings. Notice how we have insert the space
between `firstName` and `lastName`. The computer only does exactly what you tell
it to do. If you don't insert that space, it doesn't get put there.

The second line is the new way of doing this. JavaScript got a large update in
2015 and it made things a lot easier. Now you can use the back tick (notice the
first uses a double quote, you must use back ticks to do template strings) to do
template strings. If you do that, anything inside of `${yourVariableHere}` gets
output in the string. Cool, right?

### Booleans

Sometimes you just need a simple true or false. These are where booleans are
useful. Something like a light switch's state is best represented by a boolean.
A light is either on (true) or off (false). You'd have something
like `const lightIsOn = true;`. Useful and you'll see them everywhere.

### Number

Some languages separate integers (whole numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 500, 1000) and
floats (1.2, 3.14159, 14.01, etc.) differently but not JavaScript. JavaScript
just has one type of number, Number. A number is a number.

## Operators

There are lots of shortcuts you can take when programming, and there's almost
always more than one way to write an operation. Some common shortcuts are shown
below.

```jsx
let friendsAtYourParty = 0;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty += 1;
friendsAtYourParty++;
++friendsAtYourParty;
console.log(friendsAtYourParty);
```

**Result**

```jsx
4;
```

## Control Flow

### If Statements

Sometimes I want to modify the flow of how my program works, or in other words,
some time I only want to run code if some condition is true. This is
where `if` statements are very useful. Imagine if we tried this.

```
const skyIsBlue = true;

if (skyIsBlue) {
  console.log("The sky is blue!");
} else {
  console.log("The sky is … not blue?");
}
```

**Result**

```
"The sky is blue!"
```

In the above example, the condition inside of the parens is evaluated and if
it's true, the first block is run and the second is skipped. If it is false, the
second block is run and the first block is skipped. Paste that code into your
experiments and play with it. You also do not have to have an else block. Okay,
let's go further.

```jsx
if (2 + 2 === 4) {
  console.log(
    "Oh thank god, the fundamental principles of mathematics still hold true."
  );
} else {
  console.log("Uh, panic?");
}
```

**Result**

```jsx
"Oh thank god, the fundamental principles of mathematics still hold true.";
```

You can put any expression (a technical terms, means anything you can stick on
the right side of an equal sign, we'll explore it more as we go) inside of the
if statement. In this case, we are asking, is two plus two still equal to four.
If this is true (I hope so) then again the first block will be run. If not, the
second will be.

Let's talk about `===` for a second. If you use just one `=` in JavaScript, it
means **is assigned to**. So when we have `const isBrianCool = true;` you can
verbalize that as "The variable isBrianCool is assigned to true". Thus we can't
use that inside of the if statement because that's not we mean. We're trying to
ask a question, not assign something. We're trying to ask "is two plus two equal
to four." Enter the triple equals. Triple equals is the same as asking "is this
equal to that." We use the triple equals instead of the double equals because
double equals does a lot of funny business that usually we don't want it to do.
It does what's called coercion and we'll talk about that below. But in an
example `2 == "2"` but it does not `2 === "2"`. String 2 is double equal to
number 2 but string 2 is not triple equal to number 2.

There's also `!==`. This is asking "is this not equal to that". Lastly you can
ask with numbers `>` `>=` `<` `<=` as well to ask if numbers less than or
greater than too. For another example:

```
const friendsAtYourParty = 10;

if (friendsAtYourParty === 0) {
  console.log("Cool, now I have a lot of nachos to myself.");
} else if (friendsAtYourParty >= 4) {
  console.log("Perfect amount to play some Mario Kart.");
} else {
  console.log("Wooooo turn on the dance music!");
}
```

**Result**

```
"Perfect amount to play some Mario Kart."
```

This also demonstrates the `else if` if you have more than just two different
conditions.

### Loops and Iteration

Okay so now what if I want do one thing multiple times? I could do something
like this

```jsx
let friendsAtYourParty = 0;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
console.log(friendsAtYourParty);
```

**Result**

```jsx
10;
```

That's annoying though. I wish there was a better way. Before we explore that,
let's chat about this example a tad more.

We used `let` instead of `const`. Things that are `const` cannot be reassigned
later. In general I find this be of minor help but others do not so I leave you
to make your own judgement call. In general one should try to follow the
"principle of least power." You should always choose the least powerful "thing"
to accomplish whatever you're trying to do. Things with less power tend to be
simpler and simple things are less prone to having or causing bugs. We instead
use `let` here because you can see on the subsequent lines we do
reassign `friendsAtYourParty` to be a different number. If you used `const` your
code would crash because `const` won't let you do that. Thus here we use `let`.
There's another one called `var` that is the old way of doing JavaScript. There
are differences but I don't see a reason to use `var` at all anymore. It behaves
more similar to `let`.

Okay, so, we want to do this better, let's explore a few ways to do that using
loops.

### While Loops

```jsx
let friendsAtYourParty = 0;
while (friendsAtYourParty < 10) {
  friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
}
console.log(friendsAtYourParty);
```

**Result**

```jsx
10;
```

This is a while loop. The first part works similar to an `if` statement: as long
as what's inside that statement is **true** it will continue running and
re-running the body (what's between the `{ }`) until that statement is false.
Once that statement is false, it'll break the loop and continue on. This case,
we add 1 to `friendsAtYourParty` until it's 10, and then the next loop, when
it's 10, it'll stop because 10 is not less than 10.

Okay, so now let's see a second kind of loop to achieve the same effect as
above.

### For Loops

```jsx
let friendsAtYourParty = 0;
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  friendsAtYourParty++;
}
console.log(friendsAtYourParty);
```

**Result**

```jsx
11;
```

This is a for loop which is likely the most common kind of loop. Inside the
parens are three statements and you need all of them. The `let i = 0;` is you
defining your control variable that will control the loop. For some reason
people always use `i`, not sure why. It's just that way. It really could be
anything. The second statement `i <= 10` is just like the while loop, is that's
the statement that is as soon as it's false it breaks the loop. The last
statement, `i++` is that happens at the end of every loop. In our case, we
increment the control variable `i` so that it creeps closer to the end of the
loop each time.

An important note: in coding, we start counting from 0. In English, we
count `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.` but in coding we count `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.`. So the
fifth element of a string is index 4 (where index is how we'd refer to where
that item is in the string). Index 0 is the first element. It's weird but you
get used to it and it makes a lot of things easier.

Sometimes, if you mess up what's inside the control condition for the loop,
you'll get a runaway loop that'll never complete. This is called an **infinite
loop** and it'll lock up and crash your code. Something like this:

```jsx
let friendsAtYourParty = 1;
while (friendsAtYourParty > 0) {
  friendsAtYourParty = friendsAtYourParty + 1;
}
console.log(friendsAtYourParty);
```

Since you're adding one to friendsAtYourParty each time, and the loop will
continue each time until it's less than zero, that condition will never happen.
Thus it'll continue going until it crashes your code. Be careful of these. Nasty
bugs.

## Functions

A function is a bit of re-usable code. Just how we like to re-use CSS classes,
we love to re-use code. Let's start with an example:

```jsx
function addTwo(number) {
  return number + 2;
}

const finalAnswer = addTwo(5);
console.log(finalAnswer);
```

**Result**

```jsx
7;
```

This isn't super useful but hopefully it shows you the mechanics of how a
function works. We created a function called addTwo. This function takes in one
parameter, number and it returns that number with 2 added to it. We can now use
that addTwo function as much as we want! Let's make a something a bit more
useful.

```jsx
function greet(firstName, lastName, honorific, greeting) {
  return `${greeting} ${honorific} ${lastName}! I’m extremely pleased you could join us, ${firstName}! I hope you enjoy your stay, ${honorific} ${lastName}.`;
}

console.log(greet("Clément", "Mihailescu", "Lord", "Salutations"));
console.log(greet("Patrick", "Shyu", "Millionare", "A-hoy"));
```

**Result**

```jsx
"Salutations Lord Mihailescu! I’m extremely pleased you could join us, Clément! I hope you enjoy your stay, Lord Mihailescu.";
"A-hoy Millionare Shyu! I’m extremely pleased you could join us, Patrick! I hope you enjoy your stay, Millionare Shyu.";
```

Now we rather than have to repeate ourselves over-and-over again with that long
string, we can just call greet with the appropriate parameters. Here we use four
parameters. The order is important that we send in the parameters because this
will be the order function receives these parameters. You can have as many or as
few parameters as you like.

The way we **call** a function is you add parens to the end of it, like
this: `someFunctionName()`. If you see parens after a variable name, you
instantly know that that's a function. Inside of the parens go the parameters.
These variables will be passed to the function that is being called in the order
that you put them there. Example:

```jsx
const myHomeCity = "Salt Lake City";
const myHomeState = "Utah";
const myHomeCountry = "USA";

function logOutYourHome(city, state, country) {
  console.log(`You are from ${city}, ${state} ${country}.`);
}

logOutYourHome(myHomeCity, myHomeState, myHomeCountry);
```

**Result**

```jsx
"You are from Salt Lake City, Utah USA.";
```

:::

## Builtins

Lots of functions already exist for you! Smart people have created this
commonly-used functions for things we often need. For example, say you have a
string and you want to make everything lowercase, you can do this:

```jsx
const sentence = "ThIs HaS wEiRd CaSiNg On It";
console.log(sentence.toLowerCase());
```

**Result**

```jsx
"this has weird casing on it";
```

Always be looking for the parens. And the best place to look all this stuff up
is from our friends at Mozilla (makers of
Firefox): [the MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). MDN used to stand for
"Mozilla Developer Network" I think but now it's just synonmous with the
documentation for the web. I literally look at this website several times a day.
As I said before, you are not expected to remember everything. Looking things up
on the MDN is **not** cheating.

You can call `Math.round(5.1)` and it'll return that number rounded (in
this, `5`). You can
use `string.substr(indexToStart, howManyCharactersToInclude)` to return part of
a string. For
example `const name = "Brian Holt"; console.log(name.substr(6, 3))` logs
out `"Hol"` (remember numbering starts at 0). We'll introduce them as we go but
know there are a _lot_ of them. You'll learn by doing.

```jsx
console.log(Math.round(5.1));

const name = "John Denero";
console.log(name.substr(5, 4));
```

**Result**

```jsx
5;
("Dene");
```

## Data Types

- `undefined` vs `null` and use cases

A brief note on what is called **types** in JavaScript. We've danced the idea
already and I want to make it a little more concrete for you. Strings, booleans,
objects, arrays, numbers, these are different types of types. JavaScript is a
language where you don't have to concern yourself _a lot_ with types since it
doesn't strictly enforce them (other languages do) but in this problem you are
definitely going to have to deal with it.

```jsx
const num = 10;
const str = "test";
console.log(num, typeof num); // this is a number here
console.log(str, typeof str); // it's a string here
```

result:

```jsx
10 "number"
"test" "string"
undefined
```

Since you're doing math here, you'll need the numbers to actually be of the
number type. Otherwise you'll get `"5" + "5" = "55"`. There's a function
called `parseInt(string)` that will turn a string of a number (`"5"`) to a
number (`5`).

You'll also see that we used the `typeof` operator. `typeof` tells whatever the
type of the thing that comes right after it is. This is useful to quickly see
what's happening in your code. Be careful because `typeof` is not always useful,
but it is useful for telling numbers and strings apart.

## Objects

So far we've talked about having one variable at a time: one first name, one
last name, one price, etc. What if we have a collection of data? It'd be nice to
group together like data. Good news! You can!

```jsx
const person = {
  name: "Josh Hug",
  city: "Austin",
  state: "TX",
  favoriteFood: "🌮",
  wantsTacosRightNow: true,
  numberOfTacosWanted: 100,
};

console.log(person);
console.log(person.name);
console.log(person["name"]); // same as the line above; definitely prefer using the other one
```

**Result**

```jsx
Object {
  "city": "Austin",
  "favoriteFood": "🌮",
  "name": "Josh Hug",
  "numberOfTacosWanted": 100,
  "state": "TX",
  "wantsTacosRightNow": true,
}
"Josh Hug"
"Josh Hug"
```

This is called an object. They're extremely useful in JavaScript, and are very
similar to dictionaries in python. They're how you'll group together
like-information so that they can be used together. They contain a bunch
of **keys** and **values**. The keys are on the left side of the `:` and
represent how you get that piece data of out of the object. `name` is one such
key.

Used in conjunction with functions they're very powerful. Take this example:

```jsx
const person1 = {
  name: "Sahil",
  ageRange: "18-20",
};
const person2 = {
  name: "Sarah",
  ageRange: "20-22",
};

function suggestMusic(person) {
  if (person.ageRange === "18-20") {
    console.log("Drake");
  } else if (person.ageRange === "20-22") {
    console.log("Illenium");
  } else {
    console.log("The Beatles");
  }
}

suggestMusic(person1);
suggestMusic(person2);
```

**Result**

```jsx
"Drake";
"Illenium";
```

Now we're able to pass all this information as one package which makes it easy
to keep track of since we're just passing one variable. You'll see this become
even more useful as we start integrating with servers and APIs.

Objects can even have their functions! Let's see that.

```jsx
const dog = {
  name: "dog",
  speak() {
    console.log("woof woof");
  },
};

dog.speak();
```

**Result**

```jsx
"woof woof";
```

Objects can as well have nested objects inside of them.

```jsx
const me = {
  name: {
    first: "Brian",
    last: "Holt",
  },
  location: {
    city: "Seattle",
    state: "WA",
    country: "USA",
  },
};

console.log(me);
```

**Result**

```jsx
Object {
  "location": Object {
    "city": "Seattle",
    "country": "USA",
    "state": "WA",
  },
  "name": Object {
    "first": "Brian",
    "last": "Holt",
  },
}
```

## JSON

**JSON** — short for **JavaScript Object Notation** — is a format for sharing
data. As its name suggests, JSON is derived from the JavaScript programming
language, but it’s available for use by many languages including Python, Ruby,
PHP, and Java. JSON is usually pronounced like the name “Jason.”

JSON uses the `.json` extension when it stands alone. When it’s defined in
another file format (as in `.html`), it can appear inside of quotes as a JSON
string, or it can be an object assigned to a variable. This format is easy to
transmit between web server and client or browser. Very readable and
lightweight, JSON offers a good alternative to XML and requires much less
formatting.

It is important to keep in mind that though they look similar, a JSON object is
not the same format as a JavaScript object, so, though you can use functions
within JavaScript objects, you cannot use them as values in JSON. The most
important attribute of JSON is that it can be readily transferred between
programming languages in a format that all of the participating languages can
work with. JavaScript objects can only be worked with directly through the
JavaScript programming language.

If you have data stored in a JavaScript object, you can convert the object into
JSON, and send it to a server. You don't need to worry about what "send it to a
server" means right now - you can just think of it as a way to send data to our
database, much like how when you post on Facebook, Facebook sends that post's
data to their database, which is hosted on a server. This is why you might hear
someone say that they're "sending data to a server" when they're sending data to
a database.

We use `JSON.stringify()` to convert an Object into a JSON datatype.

```jsx
let myObj = { name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York" };
let myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
console.log(myJSON);
```

**Result**

```jsx
{"name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York"}
```

If you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a JavaScript object.
We use `JSON.parse()` to convert JSON into an Object datatype.

```jsx
let myJSON = '{"name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York"}';
let myObj = JSON.parse(myJSON);
console.log(myObj);
```

**Result**

```jsx
{name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"}
```

Notice how there's quotes around the JSON's keys but not the Object's keys. This
is because while Javascript Object keys don't need to be in quotes, and can be
in single or double quotes if they are in quotes, JSON keys **must** be double
quoted.

## Arrow Functions

A shorthanded way of writing a normal function. Can omit {} and return if return
something directly

```jsx
let addNums = (n1, n2) => {
  return n1 + n2;
};

let addNums = (n1, n2) => n1 + n2;
```

## Arrays

Objects are un-ordered collections of datas using keys and values. Arrays, in
contrast, are ordered collections of data. If you put something in an array, it
has an order. For example, you might a list of the days of the week.

```jsx
const daysOfTheWeek = [
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday",
  "Sunday",
];
console.log(daysOfTheWeek);
console.log(daysOfTheWeek[0]);
console.log(daysOfTheWeek[1]);
console.log(daysOfTheWeek[6]);
```

**Result**

```jsx
Array [
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday",
  "Sunday",
]
"Monday"
"Tuesday"
"Sunday"
```

You first can see how we declare an array, using `[ ]`. Inside of an array, you
can store anything you can store in a variable. You can have an array of
numbers, an arry of strings, an array of objects, an array of arrays, an array
of arrays of arrays, etc.

You can also see above how we access individual elements in an array: we use
square brackets again and then we reference the number that we want to access.
Again, remember, the numbering starts at 0. So the first element is index 0.

Arrays also have many methods (another word for functions that live on an
object) and properties (another word for key/value pairs) that live on them.
Let's see some of those:

```jsx
const primeNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17];
console.log(primeNumbers.length);
console.log(primeNumbers.join(" | "));
```

**Result**

```jsx
8;
("1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 | 13 | 17");
```

`primeNumbers.length` gives you back an number that is how long the array is. In
this case there are eight elements in the array so it gives us
back `8`. `primeNumbers.join(" | "))` takes your whole array and makes it into
one string. THe `" | "` paramenter I'm passing is what I want put between each
element, so you end up with the string `"1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 | 13 | 17"`.

So what if I want to add an element to the array after I've created. Use `push`!

```jsx
const courses = [
  { teacher: "John Denero", course: "CS 61A" },
  { teacher: "Paul Hilfinger", course: "CS 61B" },
  { teacher: "Nick Weaver", course: "CS 161" },
  { teacher: "Dan Garcia", course: "CS 61C" },
];

courses.push({ teacher: "Josh Hug", course: "Data 100" });

console.log(courses);

courses[2] = {
  teacher: "Anant Sahai",
  course: "How to Have 2 Hours of Free Time Per Week",
};

console.log(courses);
```

**Result**

```jsx
Array [
  Object {
    "course": "CS 61A",
    "teacher": "John Denero",
  },
  Object {
    "course": "CS 61B",
    "teacher": "Paul Hilfinger",
  },
  Object {
    "course": "CS 161",
    "teacher": "Nick Weaver",
  },
  Object {
    "course": "CS 61C",
    "teacher": "Dan Garcia",
  },
  Object {
    "course": "Data 100",
    "teacher": "Josh Hug",
  },
]
Array [
  Object {
    "course": "CS 61A",
    "teacher": "John Denero",
  },
  Object {
    "course": "CS 61B",
    "teacher": "Paul Hilfinger",
  },
  Object {
    "course": "How to Have 2 Hours of Free Time Per Week",
    "teacher": "Anant Sahai",
  },
  Object {
    "course": "CS 61C",
    "teacher": "Dan Garcia",
  },
  Object {
    "course": "Data 100",
    "teacher": "Josh Hug",
  },
]
```

The first thing we do is add an element to the end using the push function that
arrays have. It "pushes" the element on the end.

Below that, we're overriding index 2 with a new course. This will throw away
what was there before and set it to be what we've set it to be.

Okay, now, given that, what if we wanted to `console.log` everything in the
array? You already have all the tools to do that? Let's see to do it.

```jsx
const cities = [
  "Seattle",
  "San Francisco",
  "Salt Lake City",
  "Amsterdam",
  "Hong Kong",
];

// method 1
for (let i = 0; i < cities.length; i++) {
  console.log(cities[i]);
}

// method 2
cities.forEach(function (city) {
  console.log(city);
});
```

**Result**

```jsx
"Seattle";
"San Francisco";
"Salt Lake City";
"Amsterdam";
"Hong Kong";
"Seattle";
"San Francisco";
"Salt Lake City";
"Amsterdam";
"Hong Kong";
```

The first way, using a for loop, we're using that `i` control variable which
gets incremented each loop. We use that `i` to access each item in the array on
each iteration of the loop. We have the loop stop when `i` gets equal to
the `length` of cities. Very useful pattern. You'll see it a lot.

The second way is using a function that arrays have called `forEach`.
This `forEach` method takes in a function and that function will be called once
on each item of the array. It will pass that item into the function, which is
what `city` is in this situation. Both are useful patterns to know. You'll use
both frequently. While you're getting started, just use the one you feel
comfortable with. They have different things that make them preferable in
different situations but usually you can use either. Method 2 may be a bit more
advance but I don't think you should be scared of it.

### Spread operator (...):

The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS objects. Using
this operator makes the code concise and enhances its readability.

```jsx
let fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
let another_fruits = [...fruits, "papaya"]; //["apple", "orange", "banana", "papaya"]
```
