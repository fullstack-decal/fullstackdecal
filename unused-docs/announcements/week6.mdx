Assignments:

DUE MAR 20: (React) HW 4 Tic Tac Toe. There is hints on https://fullstackdecal.com/docs/Lessons/Lesson9-2  on how to make tic tac toe with class components, but for the purposes of learning up to date practices of react (as well as it being simpler in my opinion), we urge you to use functional components. There are also 4 short answer reading questions on Gradescope.
