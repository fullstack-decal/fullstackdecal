# Basic UI/UX

## Intro to Design

Design is the foundation to products and solutions all around us. It is the
instruction manual for developers and it is the roadmap that allows us to
achieve the goals of our site.

> “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it
> works.” –Steve Jobs

Where is design? Everywhere. From the keyboard you type on to the shoes you wear
to this page you’re looking at now, design hides in plain sight in our every day
lives.

### Importance of Design

Design is the first impression, the face of your product. Your design represents
your product in the most easily judged ways: visually and usability. Design is
also how your user interacts with your product. Good design ensures your users
will have the intended experience with your product. Without good design, the
user experience of your product will be negatively impacted greatly.

### What is Good Design?

Good design is **user centered**. By keeping your designs user centered, your
products/solutions will be designed specifically for your user needs. This will
create a more targeted and effective solution. Good design is also
**accessible**. There are many different kinds of people in the world. Good
design targets user groups but also understands that even within user groups,
there are many different kinds of people with different needs. Finally, good
design is **intuitive and seamless**. Users should interact with your designs
easily. There should be absolutely no confusion as to how to use or navigate
your product.

:::tip

Attractiveness ≠ good design! Good design is a marriage of usefulness and
beauty.

:::

> “Just because something looks good doesn’t mean it’s useful. And just because
> something is useful does not make it beautiful.” — Joshua Brewer, Co-founder
> and CEO of [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/)

### Norman’s Door: A Case of Bad Design

Many times, it’s easier to spot bad design than good design. Good design allows
you to flow seamlessly through the experience while bad design creates bumps in
your experience.

Norman’s Door is a door that is difficult or confusing to use. For any door, it
should be apparent how you should interact with it. You should easily tell
whether to push or pull and which side the hinges are on. A Norman door brings
about confusion and self doubt over how you interact with it. With even the most
creative and artistic door, a plain door with a doorknob wins in goal
completion. In design, usability always wins over creativity.

## UI/UX

![UI/UX Comparison](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_UI_UX.png)

### UI: User Interface

UI design concerns the visual experience of a product. With good UI, you create
a visually appealing product. Examples of UI include:

- Typography and Color Palettes
- Images
- Buttons

### UX: User Experience

UX design focuses on the customer experience with a product. It mainly concerns
how it feels to use a product. UX is user centered. With good UX, you create a
useful and user targeted product.

**UX Research**: research often aimed to further understand your users

:::tip

UI and UX go hand in hand. Your UX research should determine how your UI should
be designed. Similarly, the way the UI is designed heavily influences the
experience of your product.

## UI Elements

Choose/design all your UI elements with intention and your users in mind! Make
sure to be consistent with your choices as well. This list is also not
completely comprehensive. There are many UI Elements, too many to go over in one
lesson. For a more comprehensive list check out
[this site](https://designvault.io/patterns/).

### Fonts/Typography

**Typeface**

- Definition: the design of lettering; a particular set of glyphs that share a
  common design

**Sans Serif vs Serif**

- Serifs = embellished
- Sans Serif = without embellishments
- When choosing fonts for your site, typically designers pick one serif and one
  sans serif.

![Fonts](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_Fonts.png)

**Hierarchy**

- Role: keep the website organized so users can easily identify which category
  of information they are viewing
- Heading 1, heading 2, text etc.

**Weights**

- Bold, italics, condensed etc.

**Size**

- Desktop: > 15px
- Mobile: > 12px

This is a very simple breakdown of fonts and typography. For more information,
feel free to check out

### Colors

You can ensure your colors go together by utilizing the color wheel. Here are
some additional resources to help you choose your colors

:::tip

"Less is more" - the more colors you have to work with, the harder it is to get
them all to work together

:::

**Contrast**

Make sure your colors are contrasting with each other. Also, make sure the color
of your text contrasts the color of the background. Here is a good use of colors
and contrast:

![Contrast](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_Contrast.png)

**Accessibility**

Color blindness is a common visual impairment that designers must consider when
choosing their colors. Here are some tips in designing with accessibility in
mind with colors:

- Use icons and colors
- Keep it minimal
- Use textures
- Use contrasting hues
- Avoid bad color combos popular with color blindness

For a more detailed breakdown of how to choose colors with accessibility in
mind, check out
[this article](https://www.getfeedback.com/resources/ux/how-to-design-for-color-blindness/).

Again, this is a very simple breakdown of colors. For additional information on
choosing your colors, check out

### Cards

As content has become more compartmentalized and personalized over the last few
years, cards have been proven to be a great way to aggregate individual pieces
of information in one place.

![Cards](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_Cards.png)

### Nav Bar

The Nav Bar is your user’s directory. It gives easy access to the main pages and
simplifies flows.

![Nav Bar 1](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_NavBar1.png)

![Nav Bar 2](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_NavBar2.png)

![Nav Bar 3](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_NavBar3.png)

### Carousels

Carousels optimize screen space by allowing multiple pieces of content to occupy
a single rotatable space.

![Carousels](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_Carousels.png)

### Buttons

Pressing a button allows a user to perform some sort of action designated by the
designer.

![Buttons](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_Buttons.png)

### States

States communicate the status of a UI element.

![States](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_States.png)

### Forms

Forms allow the product to collect a set of information from the user.

![Forms](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_Forms.png)

## Role of the Designer

Every user who interacts with your product will have some need: buying
something, acquiring information, signing up, logging in, or using a certain
feature. **It’s up to the designer to ensure the smoothest and most attractive
way for the user to accomplish their goal.**

Here are some typical responsibilities of a web designer:

- Create graphics and features
  - Designing the UI of the website
  - Deciding what is the best way to implement (or not implement) a certain
    feature
- Design the user flow
  - Where does this button lead to? How do we get to a certain page?
- Conduct UX research
  - Conduct interviews, develop surveys etc
  - Define user personas and storyboard to identify target users and their pain
    points/needs
- Communicate with developers and clients
  - Visualize and put to paper the needs and visions of clients
  - Ensure their designs are feasible for developers to build
  - Relay intended behaviors of features and designs to developers

## Tools of the Trade

### Adobe Illustrator

Illustrator is a powerful tool that is typically used for graphic design. It’s not commonly used for web or interface design but is often used to create graphics that are used in an interface. Examples of designs made in Illustrator:

![Illustrator](../assets/Lesson12/Lesson12_IL.png)

### Figma

Figma is a tool for prototyping and designing interfaces. Compared to Illustrator, it is not as good for complex graphics, however, Figma is also occasionally used for more simple graphic designs. The tool is targeted towards UI/UX and Product Designers with features such as simulating clicks, buttons, swipes, animations, and live updates/collaboration. To download Figma for education, follow [this link](https://www.figma.com/education/). Examples of designs made in Figma:

[Barra Labs](https://www.figma.com/proto/5V6vxbrBIjTiboGlLeaE33/BarraLabs-Drafts?node-id=308%3A4&scaling=min-zoom)

[Best Path Transport](https://www.figma.com/proto/XyvI8u5I8NvhFey7gkUrnN/Table-Pages?node-id=257%3A1506&scaling=contain)

### Other Tools

- **Framer**: for prototyping interfaces specifically, integration with Figma
- **Sketch**: not a web application, similar to Figma though
- **Adobe _XD_**: An Adobe product, not for teams. Interface design tool.

## Industry Jobs
