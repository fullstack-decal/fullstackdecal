/*
  Add data for the course schedule here. All dates can be relative with respect to the start date included on the schedule object, which should be the Sunday of the first lecture in the class.
  Additionally, in the schedule object you can set the day indexes for all lecture days so lectures are automatically tied to a specific lecture day.
  
  For the weeks list, add objects of type Week to add an additional week card to the schedule screen.
  
  Example:

  {
    title: "Welcome to the course!",
    lessons: [
      {
        topic: "Course Introduction + Github",
        reading: [{ link: "/docs/Lessons/Introduction", name: "Introduction" }],
      },
      {
        topic: "HTML",
        reading: [{ link: "/docs/Lessons/HTML", name: "HTML" }],
      },
    ],
  }

  Notice how a particular week does not need specific days, the current code will handle that for you based on the start date of the schedule, week index, and lecture day indexes.
  All that is needed is specific lecture names, and links to the specific readings.

  For the vitamins and projects list, add objects of type IncompleteAssignment to add support for assignment deadlines and assigned times. This information is based on week indexes,
  so you don't have to worry about manually adding specific deadline dates here.

  Example:

  {
    link: { link: "/docs/Assignments/Vitamins/HTMLCSS", name: "HTML & CSS" },
    assignedWeek: 2,
    dueWeek: 3,
    dueDay: 2,
  },

  For the name, add just the assignment name itself. The code will automatically add a vitamin/project numbering prefix based on the ordering of assignments in the respective lists.
  This also applies for checkpoints for an assignment as well. Refer to the types file to see how they are built in the IncompleteAssignment type. Prefix numbering will also be handled there.

  For schedule data, the most important thing is the ordering within the lists. This is also the code will put specific dates per week/assignment. This also allows an easy re-ordering of the schedule if plans change without worrying about re-writing dates.
